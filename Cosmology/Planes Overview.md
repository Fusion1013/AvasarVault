# Preword & Definitions
Before we get into the planar layout of Avasar, we have to define what kinds of different planes there are.
## Major & Minor Planes
The differences between Major & Minor Planes are somewhat difficult to define, since there are no actual physical or metaphysical differences between them. The inner planes are generally considered major planes, while the outer planes are generally considered minor planes, though there are some notable exceptions.
## Transitive Planes
A transitive plane is a plane that enables travel between two or more other planes. These planes often have ‘fuzzier’ characteristics, taking on the attributes of the other planes where they overlap, blending them together. There are two types of Transitive Planes; Minor Transitive Planes, which encompass 2-4 other planes, and Major Transitive Planes, which encompass >5 other planes. Note that a Transitive Plane that encompasses only one other plane cannot exist, per definition. Such a plane would be what is known as a Bubble Plane.
## Bubble Planes
Bubble Planes are small planes that are connected in some way to one other plane. They can encompass the plane, or border it.
# Material Plane & Its Echoes
Echo planes feature the same general geography as its parent plane, with minor differences. For example, the Shadow Plane is a dark echo of the Material Plane.

# Planar Travel
Interplanar travel is not a difficult task for mortals to achieve, but is considered incredibly dangerous. Generally, only formidable nations have systems for traversing different planes in a relatively safe manner. They take these risks due to the massive economic benefits it can bring, such as the access of valuable materials not available on the Material Plane.
## Planar Portals
Planar portal is a general term for a stationary interplanar connection that links a specific location on one plane to a specific location on another. Portals can take on many forms. They can resemble doorways or fog shrouded passages, where travel is as simple as stepping through. Other portals can be locations or structures; circles of standing stones, soaring towers, sailing ships, or even whole towns can exist in multiple planes at once or flicker from one plane to another.

Larger portals of this nature are uncommon, with only a few permanent ones currently known. Some of these have been claimed by cities or nations, and significant infrastructure has been constructed around them to facilitate travel & transport goods. An example of this would be the [[Saxum Sovereignty Overview|Saxum Sovereignty]]'s access to [[Tenebris]] to obtain [[Targath]] and [[Aururum]], through the rift in [[Odverg, City of Metal]]. In some rare cases, organizations not associated with any nation control these permanent portals. This includes MONESTARY MAYBE? which uses it for religious purposes.

Smaller portals are relatively common, particularly in locations of high magical or planar turbulence. EXAMPLES OF LOCATIONS. These are usually temporary gateways that only stay open for a limited amount of time, or only open under specific conditions. These kinds of portals are the most dangerous; there are records of people going missing, presumed to have stumbled upon and subsequently vanished through a temporary portal. Some groups, either sponsored by their respective nations or from independent sources, try to track down and study these portals.

Most portal locations have thematic similarities to the planar location they are linked to. When it comes to permanent portals this might be in the form of significant alterations to the landscapes surrounding them EXAMPLES. Smaller gateways may impose smaller environmental effects on the surrounding area, such as discolored mist or strange animal behavior.

No matter the form they take, portals are generally unpredictable in nature. Some might only work during specific times: during a full moon on the Material Plane, every ten days, or when the stars or moons are in a particular position. Once it opens, such a portal might only remain open for a limited time, such as for three days following the full moon or for only an hour. Others might only function if a particular condition is met: on a clear night, when it rains, or when a certain spell is cast nearby. It may be random, require a command word, or some other kind of key.
### Area of Planar Flux
An area of planar flux can form in an area with strong dimensional connections. It causes rifts to frequently open and close in an area, leading to random locations on other planes.
## Spells
Spells can be used to travel across planes on demand, with varying levels of precision. The problem with most spells is their limited use when it comes to transporting large amounts of materials. However, they can be used to quickly reach a specific location on a different plane.
# Planar Magic
Each plane has its own magic connected to it. Each of these plains can be drawn upon by practitioners of arcane magic, or through the guidance of gods. For example, the Plane of Dreams is a powerful source of illusion magic, while the Dark Beyond is a source of Necromantic energy.
# Planar Attunement
During the Planar Concordance the gods hid the secrets to ascension, to attunement. They made a pact to present a united front against anyone who would attempt to ascend.
