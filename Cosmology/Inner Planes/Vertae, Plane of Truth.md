# Overview
Vertae, the Plane of Truth, is a realm of absolute honesty and transparency. Those who enter Vertae find themselves unable to speak a falsehood or conceal any truth from others, whether by speech, action, or even thought. Visitors to Vertae must be prepared to confront their truths. For some, this can be a transformative experience that leads to greater self-awareness and growth. For others, it can be a humbling and painful experience that exposes their flaws and shortcomings. Those who seek to enter Vertae must be prepared to face the truth, no matter how difficult or uncomfortable it may be.

# Notes
Rule - cannot deliberately speak lie

Celestials would represent what is good about truth, basically just that it is true

Fiends tell of forbidden, upsetting truths better kept locked away
