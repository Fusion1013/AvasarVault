# Overview
Specialized vessels specifically designed to traverse [[Planes Overview#Transitive Planes|Transitive Planes]]. Their design binds them to the chosen plane, disallowing it and anyone on board from exiting it.
# Construction
Each [[Voidsail]] has a piece of metal embedded at its core native to the plane they are bound to. This piece of metal is constantly bombarded by energy to keep it active, binding the ship to the plane. A [[Voidsail]] has to be constructed on the plane it wishes to remain on, otherwise it will tear itself apart upon activation of the engine.
