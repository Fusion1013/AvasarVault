*"Dream, little shadow. Dream with me"*
# Overview
The [[Plane of Dreams|Astral Realm]], known colloquially as the [[Plane of Dreams]] is a Major Transitive Plane that encompasses all Inner Planes, though it holds a particularly strong connection to the Material Plane and [[The Dark Beyond]]. It is shaped by the collective unconsciousness of all creatures, the imagination of a billion souls giving form to and shaping it. It is a place of vivid and often bizarre dreams and visions. The [[Plane of Dreams]] is often portrayed as a surreal and ever-changing realm, where laws of physics and reality are subject to constant flux. Dreams may manifest in the form of living nightmares, idyllic landscapes, or bizarre surrealistic scenes, depending on the thoughts and emotions of those who dream them.
# Environment
The geography of the Plane of Dreams mimics the journey from life to death (or vise versa). The areas closer to the Mortal Plane is where the ‘good’ Dreams live, with idyllic landscapes, full of life. The areas closer to [[The Dark Beyond]] are where nightmares live. It is unknown why the Plane of Dreams seems to hold a stronger connection to these two planes over all the others. Some theorize that it is due to the fact that recently deceased souls need to travel through the Plane of Dreams to reach [[The Dark Beyond]], and as such has a stronger connection due to the frequency of travel, though this theory has never been proven.

The Plane of Dreams does still mimic all the other planes, depending on how close they are at any given location, though the Mortal Plane and [[The Dark Beyond]] have a much stronger influence.

Exploring the plane itself is difficult. It is very easy to accidentally slip into other planes, where they overlap with the [[Plane of Dreams]]. Specialized vessels known as [[Voidsail|Voidsails]] have been constructed for this purpose. Their design binds them to the [[Plane of Dreams]], not allowing them or anyone on board to slip into another plane. Excursions outside of the ship still have to be attempted with caution, since as soon as an entity leaves the confines of the ship they are once again subject to planar shifts.
# Source of Magic
The Plane of Dreams is the source of most illusion magic, and is what most wizards draw upon to shape reality to their illusory dreams. Its closeness to the [[Material Plane]] makes it especially easy to draw upon, and is therefor one of the more common forms of magic.
# Connection with Other Planes
It is common that arcane practitioners use the Plane of Dreams to communicate with or even travel to other planes, due to its transitive nature. Due to its connection to the [[Material Plane]], arcane scholars operating out of the [[Material Plane]] are likely to use the [[Plane of Dreams]] during their planar excursions. Scholars from other planes have been recorded using other, lesser known transitive planes for their exploits, though this is less common. One of the comforts of using the [[Plane of Dreams]] is that it touches all Inner Planes, allowing travel to all of them using one known step.

In order to reach other Inner Planes from the [[Plane of Dreams]] reliably, some sort of focus attuned to the target plane is needed. This focus acts as a compass, guiding the arcane user towards the plane.

Its strong connection to [[The Dark Beyond]] makes it even more favourable to use if attempting to reach the plane. The [[Plane of Dreams]] is also what newly dead souls need to traverse to reach the afterlife.

It is possible to, purposely or accidentally, enter the Plane of Death through deep meditation or sleep. Most of the time this manifests as especially vivid dreams, and are of no harm to the dreamer. However, in certain circumstances, people have been recorded slipping into the [[Plane of Dreams]] and never waking up. What happened to them in there to cause them to not wake up is unknown.
