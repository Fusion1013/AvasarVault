# Overview
# Cultures
*For where each culture can be found, see the [[Human Culture Map]]*.

In [[Home Page|Avasar]], there are a number of different **Human** Cultures. Each culture is usually associated with a particular homeland, for example [[Turochian]] people from the [[Turochan Kingdom Overview|Turochan Kingdom]], or the [[Lithans]] from the [[Saxum Sovereignty Overview|Saxum Sovereignty]], though people from different homelands might find themselves in other countries and have their origins mixed. For example, someone might have the appearance of a [[Turochian]] but the mannerisms of a [[Lithans|Lithian]].
