**NAME PENDING**

[[Mineralborn]] are people that are born with a skeleton infused by a different material. They can be of any humanoid race. People who are [[Mineralborn]] almost always have some innate magical abilities, and their skeletons can give their magic an enhanced effect compared to other practitioners.

[[Mineralborn]] are born with differing amounts of minerals infused into their skeleton. In general, higher levels of infusion provide greater magical benefits. [[Mineralborn]] that are Pure - their skeleton completely replaced by the mineral - are exceptionally rare.

When a [[Mineralborn]] consumes the mineral that is infused in their skeletons, they gained heightened magical abilities for some time, during which they *deplete* the mineral. Casting a spell will consume some of that mineral storage. A [[Mineralborn]] can choose to strain themselves and deplete a larger amount of stored mineral. This will result in a greatly increased magical effect, but it will also cause their skeleton to *crystalize*. Crystallization of the skeleton will cause it to grow outwards, forming crystals on the skeleton structure. If this is done too much it can cause the [[Mineralborn]] to suffer negative effects or, in extreme causes, death.
