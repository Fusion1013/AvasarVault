*"Seen through veils of shadow, it glints faintly, like a secret"*
# Description
The Duskmote is a delicate, bioluminescent insect that is native to [[Tenebris]]. The Duskmote gives off a soft blue glow, barely enough to illuminate the tip of a dagger. In the darkness of [[Tenebris]] however they trace ghostly trails in the air as the Duskmote drifts lazily through the air.

The Duskmote is roughly 1-2 centimeters in length. It has translucent wings veined with a subtle pattern that refract their glow. Their bodes are long and segmented, with dark chitin that helps them blend into the stone when not glowing. The light comes from bioluminescence, which occurs in a specialized light-emitting organ near the back of the creature.
# Habitat & Behaviour
They can often be found in warmer cave systems near geothermal vents or warm subterranean lakes within [[Tenebris]]. They often gather in small swarms, flying slowly near the cave ceilings and walls. They are often used by cave explorers as a sign of breathable air.

They feed on fungal spores.
