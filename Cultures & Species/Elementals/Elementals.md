# Overview
# Origin
A vast majority of naturally formed elementals originate from the [[Elemental Plane of Chaos]], where they are formed in the crucible of chaotic elemental energies. Elementals form in areas of high concentration of particular elemental energies. Depending on the strength of the elemental energies in the area, the resulting creature may be a small Fire Snake or a terrifying Leviathan. Elementals are usually only composed of one such element, though sometimes different kinds of elemental energies can mix together, forming an impure being of differing elements.
## Sprites
Small elementals are relatively common, appearing close to any sufficiently large concentration of elemental energies. Elementals of this size are known as [[Sprites]]. [[Sprites]] come in a variety of different forms, but they are always influenced by their environment. A Fire Sprite given form from a campfire might appear playful, lazily hopping around in the fire. A Fire Sprite formed during a house fire on the other hand might appear more aggressive, spreading the fire, fanning the flames.

The most common type of [[Sprites|Sprite]] are Water [[Sprites]], forming in bodies of water of a sufficient size. They can commonly be found along coastlines, among docks, or following ships. They can take the form of fish, small sea serpents, or other ocean-dwelling fauna.

Fire [[Sprites]] can be found in smaller fires, such as fireplaces or bonfires.
## Creating Elementals
Elementals can also be created through magical means. Most spells that create elementals do not pull an existing one from the [[Elemental Plane of Chaos]]. Instead, it pulls elemental energies from the surrounding area, concentrating it into a new elemental being. When creating a Stone Elemental for example, rock might be pulled from a nearby cliff. For more powerful spells, energy might be pulled from the [[Elemental Plane of Chaos]] itself. When creating an elemental through these means, a small part of the casters soul is imbued into the created elemental, binding it to the caster. Removing the soul without banishing the elemental can have different effects depending on the nature of the spell.
# Elemental Types

## [[The Lakespawn]]
