# Overview
# Origin
A vast majority of naturally formed elementals originate from the [[Elemental Plane of Chaos]], where they are formed in the crucible of chaotic elemental energies. Elementals form in areas of high concentration of particular elemental energies. Depending on the strength of the elemental energies in the area, the resulting creature may be a small Fire Snake or a terrifying Leviathan. Elementals are usually only composed of one such element, though sometimes different kinds of elemental energies can mix together, forming an impure being of differing elements.
## Sprites
Small elementals are relatively common, appearing close to any sufficiently large concentration of elemental energies. Elementals of this size are known as [[Sprites]]. [[Sprites]] come in a variety of different forms, but they are always influenced by their environment. A Fire Sprite given form from a campfire might appear playful, lazily hopping around in the fire. A Fire Sprite formed during a house fire on the other hand might appear more aggressive, spreading the fire, fanning the flames.

As long as a sprite is in physical contact with their element their life will be sustained. As soon as they leave their element they will start deteriorating, the speed depending on the size of the [[Sprites|Sprite]]. Normal size sprites can last outside of their element for only around 30 seconds before fading.
### Water Sprites
The most common type of [[Sprites|Sprite]] are Water [[Sprites]], forming in bodies of water of a sufficient size. They can commonly be found along coastlines, among docks, or following ships. They can take the form of fish, small sea serpents, or other ocean-dwelling fauna.
### Fire Sprites
Fire [[Sprites]] can be found in smaller fires, such as fireplaces or bonfires. They are fickle in nature, only living for at most a few minutes before returning to the [[Elemental Plane of Chaos]]. New ones quickly take their place, dancing among the flames.
### Air Sprites
Air Sprites mostly prefer to stay invisible, but sometimes show themselves. They are whimsical creatures, just like the winds they ride on. Like other Sprites, they take on the characteristics of the winds that carry them. They might be seen floating along a calm summer breeze, taking the shape of ribbons floating through the air. They might take the shape of violent birds, raging through the storms.
### Earth Sprites
Earth Sprites are among the rarer version of [[Sprites|Sprite]]. They are most often seen deep underground, crawling through caves in the shape of snails or crabs made from rock. During a rockslide they might lead the charge, leaving death and destruction in their wake.
### Arcane Sprites
It has long been debated if arcane energy is a type of Elemental Energy or not. One occurrence that lends credence to this argument is the existence of Arcane Sprites. They form in areas of high magical concentrations, where extreme feats of magic have been performed. They are elusive, rarely showing themselves. An archmage might go their entire life without ever seeing one.

Not much is known about them due to their elusive nature. It might take a researcher years to get the opportunity to study one, and it might only be in existence for a fraction of a second. This short section contains all the information we have been able to gather over years of study.

## Creating Elementals
Elementals can also be created through magical means. Most spells that create elementals do not pull an existing one from the [[Elemental Plane of Chaos]]. Instead, it pulls elemental energies from the surrounding area, concentrating it into a new elemental being. When creating a Stone Elemental for example, rock might be pulled from a nearby cliff. For more powerful spells, energy might be pulled from the [[Elemental Plane of Chaos]] itself. When creating an elemental through these means, a small part of the casters soul is imbued into the created elemental, binding it to the caster. Removing the soul without banishing the elemental can have different effects depending on the nature of the spell.
# Elemental Types
There are a few different elemental [[Creatures Overview|creature]] types, that were created in a few different ways.
## Sari
Named after the god [[Mau'Sari - the Divine Essence|Mau'Sari]]. This is the group name given to most elementals. They can then be further subdivided into more groups, some listed below.
## [[The Lakespawn]]
Created by the [[Anvarra - the Soulless Mistress|Godess of Life, Anvarra]]. Has no relation to the Sari.
