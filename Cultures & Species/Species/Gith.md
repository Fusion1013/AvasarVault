# History
The Gith originate from the [[Plane of Dreams|Astral Realm]], formed from the nightmares of the [[Mindflayers]]. They are an amalgamation of the [[Mindflayers]] worst fears, a warrior race strong enough to stand against them. Though they were originally formed in the [[Plane of Dreams|Astral Realm]], due to the strange warping of time and space that happens on the plane the Gith cannot have their children in there. They instead seek out strongholds on other worlds where groups can travel to produce offspring. The [[Material Plane]] is the most common location the Gith travel to, due to its strong connection to the [[Plane of Dreams]].

The Gith have gained an innate ability to exist on the [[Plane of Dreams]] without shifting into other planes. As a result of this they always feel a sense of lacking when they are off the plane, and feel a strange pull to return to it that only grows stronger they are away from the plane.

The Gith are a warrior race sworn to the destruction of their mortal enemies, the [[Mindflayers]]. They are divided into two sects with different beliefs and cultures, the Githyanki and the Githzerai. The two sects have been at odds for centuries. Though both of them work towards the same goals, they believe that the others have strayed from their true path, betraying their oaths.
