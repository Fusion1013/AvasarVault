# History
The Githyanki originate from the [[Plane of Dreams|Astral Realm]], formed from the nightmares of the [[Mindflayers]]. They are an amalgamation of the [[Mindflayers]] worst fears, a warrior race strong enough to stand against them. Though they were originally formed in the [[Plane of Dreams|Astral Realm]], due to the strange warping of time and space that happens on the plane the Githyanki cannot have their children in there. They instead seek out strongholds on other worlds where groups can travel to produce offspring. The [[Material Plane]] is the most common location the Githyanki travel to, due to its strong connection to the [[Plane of Dreams]].

The Githyanki have gained an innate ability to exist on the [[Plane of Dreams]] without shifting into other planes. As a result of this they always feel a sense of lacking when they are off the plane, and feel a strange pull to return to it that only grows stronger they are away from the plane.

The Githyanki are a warrior race sworn to the destruction of their mortal enemies, the [[Mindflayers]].
