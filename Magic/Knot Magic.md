*If you can tie it, it can be worked as a Knot Spell*
# Overview
Knot Magic, Thread Magic, or Knotwork Spells are incredibly simple forms of magic that common folk use throughout their lives. This type of magic can manifest in a variety of different ways, from active, specific effects, to more passive, or reactive manifestations.
# Gemstones
Gemstones can be used in combination with knots to bind effects or modify the spells. Rope or yarn can be bound around gemstones, making it act as a core for the spell.
