| 0 APC - Planar Concordance            | \-                | The Planar Concordance occured when one mortal became a god, by attuning to one of the planes and splitting it in the process. This caused a ripple of planar energy to rock the cosmos. The planes had reached critical mass. The gods decided to come together, and in a unified effort they killed the newly ascended god, bringing the cosmos into balance once more. To prevent any mortals from continuing to break apart the planes and destroy all they know, the gods hid the secrets to ascension. The gods agreed to present a united front against anyone who would attempt to ascend. This event has become year 0 for many of the major calendars |

This caused a ripple of planar energy to rock the cosmos. The planes had reached critical mass. The gods decided to come together, and in a unified effort they killed the newly ascended god, bringing the cosmos into balance once more. To prevent any mortals from continuing to break apart the planes and destroy all they know, the gods hid the secrets to ascension. The gods agreed to present a united front against anyone who would attempt to ascend. This event has become year 0 for many of the major calendars |
