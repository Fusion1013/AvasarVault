## History
Main Page: [[History of Avasar]]

Nobody, not even the gods, understand exactly how the original planes came to be. However, what is known is that mortals came to exist on the material plane. At this point in time, the gods did not exist. Instead, they were created when some powerful mortals transcended into a representation of a core ideal of another plane. After a certain amount of mortals did this, an unknown reason caused the gods to hide the knowledge and prevent anyone else from doing such a thing.
## Regions
### Elisus

A continent shattered by conflict, both ancient and new. The Fracrish Mountains offer shelter to the kingdom of Turochan, a realm torn asunder in a conflict with the gods and magic. The Saxum Sovereignty, hidden in their impenetrable cities, are divided from neighboring nations by the Dragonback Mountains, a natural barrier of stone and metal. In the south, tensions rise between the So’Dar Empire and the Holy Kingdom of Maulik. A war is brewing. Meanwhile, to the north, the Kerdion Hoard prowls the plains, guarding their territory with an iron fist.

### Overview
The cosmos is vast and complex, home to a multitude of planes and existence beyond the moral realm. These planes are connected by the mysterious fabric of the cosmos, and each is governed by its own unique laws and characteristics. Most planes are ruled by gods, some by other powerful beings. Mortals may journey these planes, but doing so often comes with great risk. The planes and the cosmos that bind them together are full of wonder, danger, and mystery, waiting to be explored by those brave enough to venture beyond the boundaries of the known world.
### The Mortal Plane
The planet known as Avasar is located within the mortal plane, orbiting around its star, Taiya. The planes of the multiverse cast reflections here, in the form of other planetary bodies.
