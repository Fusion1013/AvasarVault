### Myconid Colonizers

Mushroom hivemind that can take over a dead body. Comes in a variety of shapes and sizes, depending on the skeleton. They have been observed absorbing multiple skeletons on rare occasions, though this usually happens when two colonies accidentally merge. Will slowly consume the skeleton while relocating to a new area. When the skeleton is fully consumed, they will move to a new host. Will sometimes absorb other plant matter into itself. Has a pretty low level of intelligence. Not capable of speech of any kind.

While experimenting with different ways of growing mushrooms efficiently and speeding up their natural growth cycle, the [[Saxum Sovereignty Overview|Saxum Sovereignty]] accidentally created the Hikseta. [[Saxum Sovereignty Overview|Saxum]] attempted to discard these failed experiments, but instead the Hikseta thrived, forming a mushroom society deep below the city of [[Gulstad, City of Gold|Gulstad]].

The Hikseta are pretty small, being at most 2 feet tall. They usually live for around 2 years, though some specimens have been observed to live as long as 3 years.

They are surprisingly intelligent, some have been observed wielding rudimentary weapons such as bows, spears or swords. Some are even capable of speech, at a level resembling that of a human child. During recent years they have been seen taming animals, such as frogs and dire rats, to use as mounts.
