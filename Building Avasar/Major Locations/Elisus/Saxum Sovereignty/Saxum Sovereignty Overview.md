*"Leave those shattered plains behind"*

**Government:** A Triumvirate of three mages, along with a council of 13 representatives.
**Languages:** Old Taundorian

## Overview
Sheltered from the rest of the world by the towering [[Dragonback Mountains]] and Fracrish Mountains, the Saxum Sovereignty is a small but prosperous nation. This landscape of towering mountains and flowing hills is known for its gray skies, fits of cold rain, and occasional snowfall. The [[Dragonback Mountains]] and Fracrish Mountains shield the people from most of the threates that loom beyond the boundaries of the nation.
## History
The Saxum Sovereignty was founded in 1185 APC, not long after the cataclysm that formed the now Turochan Kingdom. Due to the new nation's anti-magic stance, practitioners of magic were hunted and banished from the kingdom. Some of these people undertook the perilous journey through the Fracrish Mountains, to the valley that now forms the Saxum Sovereignty. With the founding of the capital, this valley soon became a safe haven for practitioners of arcane and divine magic.

Relations with the Turochan Kingdom are still tense, but have significantly calmed since the earlier days. Trade has started to open up more and more over the last 20 years, as Turochan has started to relax their anti-magic policies. The construction of a major trade route through the mountains has significantly aided in these efforts. Information of magical nature is still being kept behind closed doors however.

## Major Organizations

## Magical Society
Even though this nation was founded on the idea of allowing free use of magic, there is no magic academy within this nation. Instead, magical knowledge has been passed down from generation to generation. Now, almost everyone living within the nation knows at least some magic. While mundane magic is commonly used for everyday activities, there are only a few hundred practitioners of high level magic. These individuals are often nobles living in the capital of Gulstad, or people in other positions of power.

## Economy

### Coin Designs
The coins have the current members of the Saxum Triumvirate on the front of them, surrounded by their names and the date the individual coin was printed, two numbers on each side. The individual that has been on the council the longest is on the platinum, the second longest on the gold, and the last on the silver coin. The current coins have the following names on them:
- Platinum: Igorim Ovras
- Gold: Leo Umbras
- Silver: Ezorah von Abendroth
The backs of the coins feature the symbol of the goddess of peace, Irellia, engulfed in flames. Surrounding it are 8 symbols representing the different schools of magic.
