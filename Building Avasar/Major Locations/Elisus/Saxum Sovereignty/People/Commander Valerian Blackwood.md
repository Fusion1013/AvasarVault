## Overview
He was a seasoned veteran and a respected member of [[The Saxum Triumvirate]] for 48 years. He was known for his tactical expertise and his unwavering loyalty to the Sovereignty. Valerian was a tall man with a muscular build, and his short-cropped hair was starting to gray. He had a thick beard that he kept well-groomed, and his piercing blue eyes conveyed a sense of authority and intelligence. He disappeared while leading a mission into the labyrinthine tunnels that run beneath Gulstad. The circumstances surrounding his disappearance remain a mystery to this day. His position on the Triumvirate was later taken by his second in command, [[Ezorah von Abendroth]], who remains a member of the council to this day.
