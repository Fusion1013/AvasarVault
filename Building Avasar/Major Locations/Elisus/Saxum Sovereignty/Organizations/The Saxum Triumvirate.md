## History
The [[Saxum Sovereignty Overview|Saxum Sovereignty]] owes its existence to the founding of the Triumvirat, in the year of 1185 APC. The Triumvirate was formed by a group of mages who had fled the newly-formed [[Turochan Kingdom Overview|Turochan Kingdom]], which had banned the use of magic. These mages did not want to be persecuted, and so they created the Triumvirate as a ruling body for a new nation where magic would be accepted and celebrated. Over time, the Triumvirate would become the de facto rulers of this new nation, which became known as the [[Saxum Sovereignty Overview|Saxum Sovereignty]].

The Triumvirate was founded by the mages [[Archmage Igorim Ovras|Igorim Ovras]], [[The Saxum Triumvirate#Yosif Halstrom|Yosif Halstrom]], and [[The Saxum Triumvirate#Celeste Krystof|Celeste Krystof]]. These three mages worked together to establish a new government structure in the aftermath of the cataclysm that destroyed Taundor. Over the years, the membership of the Triumvirate has changed, with new members being appointed as old ones passed away or retired. See the [[The Saxum Triumvirate#Members|Members]] section below for a complete list of all previous and current members.

Throughout its history, the Saxum Triumvirate has faced numerous challenges and crises, including rebellions, and external threats from neighboring nations. However, the Triumvirate has always managed to overcome these challenges and emerge stronger and more united than before.
