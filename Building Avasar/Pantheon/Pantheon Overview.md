## Introduction
Within the world of Avasar, there are a total of 15 different prime deities. Each prime god has been tied to one of the major planes within the cosmology of Avasar. Only these beings are considered to be part of the main Pantheon. However, other beings such as demi-gods do exist. They are instead attuned to a demiplane or something similar.

These deities are former mortals who were able to be bound to one of the original major planes. Some even tried to attune to a plane that already had a deity, causing the domain, along with the plane and the planet representing it, to be split. However, the secrets to ascend have long been lost.

No singular prime deity is good or evil. Instead, they are pure representations of the domain they control. This includes any of the positive and negative aspects within that domain. While none of the Pantheon are considered good or evil, certain events can mean their more positive or negative aspects have more influence within the Material Plane.
