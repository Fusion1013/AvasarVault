## Overview
[[Taundorian]] is also commonly spoken in the Akmé Hegemony, whose people originally fled from Turocha. However, this [[Languages Overview|Language]] has shifted from its original form over the past few hundred years, mixing with the languages of the other planes. Other [[Taundorian]] speakers can still understand this version of the language. This section of the language is known as Siar Taundorian. It is part of [[The Taundorian Languages]].
