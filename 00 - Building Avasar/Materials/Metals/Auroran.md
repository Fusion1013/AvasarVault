description: Auroran is a metal that has fallen from the upper planes in the form of shooting stars. If the metal is forged into a weapon, it counts as magical when used against fiends and undead. A skilled blacksmith can use the metal to forge weapons that deal additional radiant damage on a hit as well as armor that provides resistance to radiant damage.
