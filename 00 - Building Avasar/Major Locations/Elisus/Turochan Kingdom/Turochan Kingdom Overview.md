## History
The Turochan Kingdom is a nation that was founded after a catastrophic event that changed the continent forever. The kingdom's history dates back to the 1100’s APC, when Taundor, an island ruled by a cabal of power-hungry mages, started a great war with their neighbors. Their obsession with arcane magic caused much suffering, and their neighbors were not willing to tolerate it.

This devastating war angered the [[Irellia, Peace|Goddess of Peace, Irellia]]. During a rare event known as a [[Planes, Gods & Lunar Phases#Lunar Eclipses|Shattered Eclipse]] in 1167 APC, she grabbed the island and smashed it into the nearest continent. The cataclysmic event caused massive destruction and loss of life. The people who survived were left traumatized and bitter towards both arcane and divine magic, as they saw firsthand how it ruined their land.

In the aftermath of the war and the Eclipse, a man named Turot emerged as a leader and formed the Turochan Kingdom in 1169 APC. The kingdom was founded on the principles of disallowing all forms of magic within their borders and keeping good relations with their neighbors.

For many years, the Turochan Empire remained steadfast in its anti-magic stance. However, in recent times, the kingdom has relaxed its policies towards magic. The past twenty years have seen a gradual shift towards tolerance and acceptance of magic. These policies were started by their current King, [[Turochan Kingdom Overview#King Aulus Turochan II|Aulus Turochan II]]. Today, the Turochan Kingdom continues to thrive as a center of research and higher learning despite a large portion of the population’s disgust for these recent policies allowing magic back into the nation.
## Major Cities
### Velus
The capital and largest city of the Turochan Kingdom. This city is built atop a large plateau in the middle of the Quassus Wastes. Velus was created in the center of the destruction caused by Irellia, showing how the people overcame the hardships and death brought upon them by her. The capital city is seen as a center of learning and sciences.
### Eldhein
Eldhein is a large city to the north of the nation on one of the many islands of the Taundor Fragments. The city acts as a major hub of trade and hosts a majority of the kingdom’s fleet.
### Virston
Virston is a major city sitting on a large island to the west of the mainland of the nation. It sits at the base of multiple dormant volcanoes. The city sits near large deposits of sulfur, which was used to develop gunpowder. Virston is known for its expert artisans creating weaponry such as muskets.
### Nyrif
Nyrif is a large port city on the northern coast of the kingdom, in a bay close to the Fracrish Mountains. The city has a long history of crime, with a number of crime families fighting for control of the city.
## Major Regions
### The Taundor Fragments
The Taundor Fragments refers to the large number of islands to the north of the Kingdon’s mainland. These islands were former parts of Taundor that were shattered from the rest while it was smashed into the continent. Many of these islands are quite swampy and full of ruins from the old magocracy.
### The Quassus Wastes
This region is a spot in the center of the Kingdom which was most damaged by the moving of the island. These wastes are filled with little greenery and jagged, unnatural rock formations. Wandering off the beaten path here is ill-advised, for dangerous cursed creatures frequently roam this area.
### [[Fracrish Mountains|The Fracrish Mountains]]
