## Overview
The Plane of Life is a massive organism, a singular entity from which biological life in the mortal plane originated, seemingly accidentally. However the accident has refracted back upon the plane, causing aspects of itself to split off into Totems reflecting the various living entities in the mortal realm. Currently the Plane of Life is amusing itself by observing both these forms of life, deciding whether this diversion is worth allowing these accidental beings continued independence or if it should finally reabsorb them into itself.
