A type of grass part of the [[Velmoriths]] family, a type of [[Plant]] that retracts into the ground when it senses movement nearby. It has deep roots that protect it from being ripped up during powerful storms.

After a storm has passed the [[Slinkgrass]] grows quickly and vibrant.

The blades are edible, but not very nutritious. They give a soft lemony flavour if boiled for long enough, and are commonly used in long-boiled soups or stews.
