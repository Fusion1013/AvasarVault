A type of grass part of the [[Velmoriths]] family, a type of [[Plant]] that retracts into the ground when it senses movement nearby. It has deep roots that protect it from being ripped up during powerful storms. It has primarily been found in [[Storms Reach Overview|Storms Reach]] and surrounding areas, where it does not have to compete with other types of grass due to the powerful storm that ravages the area.

After a storm has passed the [[Slinkgrass]] grows quickly and vibrant.

The blades are edible, but not very nutritious. They give a soft lemony flavour if boiled for long enough, and are commonly used in long-boiled soups or stews.
