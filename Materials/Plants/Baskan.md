[[Baskan]] is a plant that grows primarily in [[Storms Reach Overview|Storms Reach]]. It resembles a squat, armoured fruit, much like a pineapple. It has six to twelve spider-like root-legs that sprout from its sides and clutch the earth like grasping claws. These limbs anchor the plant during violent storms, as well as provide nutrients from the soil.

The outside of the [[Baskan]] is covered in overlapping segments, not unlike scales. During calm weather, these scales relax and fold outwards, absorbing light and capturing moisture.

Locals believe that the [[Baskan]] can use its roots to move around, not unlike a spider. Names for the plant in some cultures roughly translate to *Wandering Rock* or *Spider Plant*. There is no conclusive proof that this is the case.

The meat of the fruit is tough and bitter, making it unpleasant to eat. It is high in nutritions and water content however, which combined with its longevity makes for good emergency food.
