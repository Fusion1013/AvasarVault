*In Wrᴎgord, every coin has a purpose, and every deal has a dagger. Yet, for all its peril, the treasures here gleam brighter than anywhere else in the realm.
— Olek Targavᴎch, traveling merchant from the So'Dar Empire*
# Overview
Wrᴎgord is the new capital of [[Preᴙ Overview|Preᴙ]]. It was made the capital after the fall of [[Dawnfrei|Zhᴎmchug]] in 1169 APC. This city is built at the base of the small mountain range [[Kovᴙatskiy Khrebet]], bordering the [[So'Dar Empire Overview|So'Dar Empire]]. The river [[Kovᴙ]] flows through the city. The city is home to the [[House Dorofei|Dorofei Family]], who hold major positions within the city's government.
# History
[[Wrᴎgord]] started out as a simple fortification on the side of a mountain, but quickly grew into the city it is today.
## Shift in Power
The city was made the new capital of [[Preᴙ Overview|Preᴙ]] in 1169 APC, after a successful coup to overthrow the king and fall of the previous capital [[Dawnfrei|Zhᴎmchug]] at the hands of the [[So'Dar Empire Overview|So'Dar Empire]]. The coup was staged by a group of nobles that had major influence over the politics and military of [[Wrᴎgord]], which is partly why it was chosen as the new capital. The city was the perfect location to defend against those still loyal to the old king, with the mountain protecting it from one side, and the thick forest on the other.

After the fall of [[Dawnfrei|Zhᴎmchug]], many of the noble houses in [[Wrᴎgord]] attempted to take claim to the title of ruler of [[Preᴙ Overview|Preᴙ]]. A civil war ensued, lasting for about 4 years. In the end, no single house was victorious. Instead, the different houses came to occupy different branches of government, taking joint control over [[Preᴙ Overview|Preᴙ]].

After a few generations and through a series of successful grabs of power, House Dorofei was able to place enough people in key positions to claim themselves the true rulers of the nation. House Dorofei have ruled over [[Wrᴎgord]] and [[Preᴙ Overview|Preᴙ]] for 5 generations now.
## Appearance
Since it becoming the capital in 1169 APC, the city has expanded considerably. The old fortress still remains at the back of the city, closest to the mountain. It now serves as the Council Chambers, and living quarters for the heads of [[House Dorofei]].

A large wall was constructed in 1194 APC towards the nearby forest. Since then the city has continued to expand past the walls, and the area within the walls are now only home to upper class residence and high-end shops.
# Landmarks
## **Kov**ᴙ River
This wide river flows through the center of the entire city. In the inner part of the city it has been converted into a series of canals that run through the inner city, allowing transport by water to key locations.

In the lower city the river allows for transport of goods through the city dock. The river forms an important trade route, connecting the city to both [[Ozᴎrgrod]] and [[Kovogrod]], and other nations through the [[Mauri Sea]].
