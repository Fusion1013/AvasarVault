*"In Wrᴎgord, every coin has a purpose, and every deal has a dagger. Yet, for all its peril, the treasures here gleam brighter than anywhere else in the realm."
— Olek Targavᴎch, traveling merchant from the So'Dar Empire*
# Overview
Wrᴎgord is the new capital of [[Preᴙ Overview|Preᴙ]]. It was made the capital after the fall of [[Dawnfrei|Zhᴎmchug]] in 1169 APC. This city is built at the base of the small mountain range [[Kovᴙatskiy Khrebet]], bordering the [[So'Dar Empire Overview|So'Dar Empire]]. The river [[Kovᴙ]] flows through the city. The city is home to the [[House Dorofei|Dorofei Family]], who hold major positions within the city's government.
# History
[[Wrᴎgord]] started out as a simple fortification on the side of a mountain, but quickly grew into the city it is today.
## Shift in Power
The city was made the new capital of [[Preᴙ Overview|Preᴙ]] in 1169 APC, after a successful coup to overthrow the king and fall of the previous capital [[Dawnfrei|Zhᴎmchug]] at the hands of the [[So'Dar Empire Overview|So'Dar Empire]]. The coup was staged by a group of nobles that had major influence over the politics and military of [[Wrᴎgord]], which is partly why it was chosen as the new capital. The city was the perfect location to defend against those still loyal to the old king, with the mountain protecting it from one side, and the thick forest on the other.

After the fall of [[Dawnfrei|Zhᴎmchug]], many of the noble houses in [[Wrᴎgord]] attempted to take claim to the title of ruler of [[Preᴙ Overview|Preᴙ]]. A civil war ensued, lasting for about 4 years. In the end, no single house was victorious. Instead, the different houses came to occupy different branches of government, taking joint control over [[Preᴙ Overview|Preᴙ]].

After a few generations and through a series of successful grabs of power, House Dorofei was able to place enough people in key positions to claim themselves the true rulers of the nation. House Dorofei have ruled over [[Wrᴎgord]] and [[Preᴙ Overview|Preᴙ]] for 5 generations now.
## City Structure
Since it became the capital in 1169 APC, the city has expanded considerably. The old fortress still remains at the back of the city, closest to the mountain. It now serves as the Council Chambers, and living quarters for the heads of [[House Dorofei]].

A large wall was constructed in 1194 APC towards the nearby forest. Since then the city has continued to expand past the walls, and the area within the walls is now only home to upper class residence, high-end shops and administrative buildings. Another wall was constructed in 1280 APC on the outskirts of the city. At the present the city extends even further past it.
# Districts
## High District (Vysokogrod)
This district is located closest to the base of [[Kovᴙatskiy Khrebet]], enclosed by the High Walls. It is home to the upper class, government buildings, high-end shops, and a number of cultural landmarks. It is elevated slightly above the rest of the city, with broad cobbled streets, luxurious buildings, and gleaming towers. The estate of [[House Dorofei]] and the council chambers are located here.
## Dock District (Pristan)
The city's dock district is located on the banks of the [[Kovᴙ|Kovᴙ River]], this is where ships and barges dock for trade. It is the center of [[Wrᴎgord]]'s commerce and trade. The docks are surrounded by warehouses, taverns, and market areas.
## Market District (Torgovaya Ploshchad)
The Market District is located in close proximity to the docks. It is the main hub for trade and commerce in the city, where merchants come to peddle their wares and make business. The area is often crowded, vibrant and noisy. The central market square is surrounded on all sides by rows of shops. Travelling performers and entertainers often fill the streets.
## Common District (Nizhnyy Gorod)
The common district is the main area surrounding the walls of the High District and extending to the city's outer wall. This is where the middle class and laborers live. It is a mix of living quarters and common shops. The district is lively, but less chaotic than the docks or the market square.
## Outer Ward (Zemlyanoy Val)
The Outer Ward is the area outside the outer wall. It is a sprawling district for the poorer population, such as farmers, laborers, and refugees. The area is filled with poorly constructed buildings, pop up-shops, and muddy streets.
## Industrial District (Uglevᴙsk)
The Industrial District is located on the southern side of the city, nestled between the mountain and the outer and inner walls. It is located close to the Dock District for easy transportation of materials and products. It is a place of manufacturing, smithing, and heavy industry. The area is loud, air filled with the smoke from various machinery.
## Temple District (Khrestovᴙsk)
Located to the east of the High District, next to the Inner Wall. This is the center for religious worship and spiritual guidance within the city.
## Scholar's Quarter (Ucheniy Kray)
Near the Temple District, separated by a series of small walls and gates. This area is dedicated to education, libraries, and study of the arcane arts. The area is simple but functional, with some simpler homes for the people who work there. There is a lot of greenery, in contrast to the rest of the city's more functional nature.
# Government
While [[House Dorofei]] holds key positions in the city's government, other noble houses are not powerless. [[House Terenti]] is one of the more influential families, holding a large number of minor positions in various government agencies. In recent years they have managed to gain a foothold on the country's finances, giving them more influence over the city and the nation.

While [[House Dorofei]] and [[House Terenti]] struggle for control over the city, another player has managed to enter the game. [[House Vikentiv]] have managed to take control of a majority of the trade routes in and out of the capital, giving the power over the other houses.
## The Master of Coin (Master Deneg)
The Master of Coin is a critical position, currently held by [[House Terenti]]. The Master of Coin overseas taxation, trade agreements, and the city treasury.
## High Magistrate (Glavnyy Sudya)
Oversees the city's legal system. This position is selected by consensus between the major houses to maintain neutrality, though [[House Dorofei]] typically influences the appointment. The position is currently held by [[Anatol Karskov]], an independent but subtly allied figure to [[House Dorofei|Dorofei]].
## Overseer of Trade (Nadzornik Torgovli)
Manages trade routes, market regulation, and tariffs. This position is fiercely contested, as it provides an important foothold in the city's commerce. The position has been held by members of [[House Dorofei]] for the past generation, but recently [[House Gerasim]] has come to control it.
# Landmarks
## **Kov**ᴙ River
This wide river flows through the center of the entire city. In the inner part of the city it has been converted into a series of canals that run through the inner city, allowing transport by water to key locations.

In the lower city the river allows for transport of goods through the city dock. The river forms an important trade route, connecting the city to both [[Ozᴎrgrod]] and [[Kovogrod]], and other nations through the [[Mauri Sea]].
# Religion
The deities that are publicly worshipped in [[Wrᴎgord]] reflects the values and ideals of those that rule over the city, not so much those that live there. There are large temples dedicated to both [[Vuzen, the Law Baron]] and [[Isoroa, the Shadowed Mask]] in the city's Temple District. Some smaller temples dedicate themselves to [[Saheir, the Enchantress]] or [[Veda, the Elder Scribe]]. These four make up the accepted religions within the city.

On the other hand, there are a handful of smaller communities that worship some other, less accepted gods. [[Intrix, the Prime Sculptor]] and [[Irellia, Mistress of the Tranquil Lake]] have quite a large following within the lower class folk, with small, unofficial temples or communes popping up in the city every now and then. On the outskirts of the city, closer to the forest, one might find followers of [[Verdus, the Earthweaver]] and [[Anvarra, the Soulless Mistress]]. They seldom venture into the deeper city, instead keeping on the outskirts in or outside the Outer Ward.
