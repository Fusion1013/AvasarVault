# History
[[Wrᴎgord]] started out as a simple fortification on the side of a mountain, but quickly grew into the city it is today.

The city was made the new capital of [[Preᴙ Overview|Preᴙ]] in 1169 APC, after a successful coup to overthrow the king and fall of the previous capital [[Dawnfrei|Zhᴎmchug]] at the hands of the [[So'Dar Empire Overview|So'Dar Empire]]. The coup was staged by a group of nobles that had major influence over the politics and military of [[Wrᴎgord]], which is partly why it was chosen as the new capital. The city was the perfect location to defend against those still loyal to the old king, with the mountain protecting it from one side, and the thick forest on the other.

After the fall of [[Dawnfrei|Zhᴎmchug]], many of the noble houses in [[Wrᴎgord]] attempted to take claim to the title of ruler of [[Preᴙ Overview|Preᴙ]]. A civil war ensued, lasting for about 4 years. In the end, no single house was victorious. Instead, the different houses came to occupy different branches of government, taking joint control over [[Preᴙ Overview|Preᴙ]].

After a few generations and through a series of successful grabs of power, House Dorofei was able to place enough people in key positions to claim themselves the true  nation. House Dorofei have ruled over [[Wrᴎgord]] and [[Preᴙ Overview|Preᴙ]] for 5 generations now.
