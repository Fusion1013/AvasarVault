Most of the family now lives in a [[small city]] in the countryside, not too far from the capital. They mainly work within the logging industry. They have an ongoing feud with [[Preᴙ Overview#House Dorofei|House Dorofei]] due to their history, with both trying to undermine the others affairs.

# History
# Family Values & Traits
[[House Gerasim]] strongly values family bonds and traditions. They believe that one of the worst things you can do is turn your back on family, even going as far as killing if they feel someone has betrayed their family. An example of this was the event that occurred in 1358 APC. The family found out that [[Bogdan Gerasim]] had an affair with [[Syuzanna Katenka]] with 3 children. That entire branch of the family was subsequently executed in order to keep the bloodline pure.
