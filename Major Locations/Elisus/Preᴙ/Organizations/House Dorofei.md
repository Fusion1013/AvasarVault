# Overview
House Dorofei is a noble house from [[Preᴙ Overview|Preᴙ]], operating primarily out of [[Wrᴎgord]]. This noble family has its roots since before the [[So'Dar Empire Overview|So'Dar]] war, making it one of the oldest, still intact, bloodlines. They are one of the most powerful houses within the nation, holding major positions within the Preᴙ government. More recently, the family's position has become threatened. Internal conflicts have escalated over the past few years, giving other houses an opportunity to grasp at power. [[House Terenti]] were recently able to take control of one of the most important governmental positions, appointing one of their own as Master of Coin.

The recent [[1374 APC - Tamerian Tragedy|Tamerian Tragedy]] marked a major power shift within the family, resulting in [[Aleks Dorofei]] coming to power, something that was not popular with other branches of the family. The tragedy took place in 1374 APC during a ball with multiple high-ranking noble houses. Top members of House Dorofei were in attendance and were subsequently all poisoned to death, together with most of the other attendees. After this, [[Aleks Dorofei]] swiftly rose to power, vowing to find those responsible. Eventually the tragedy was blamed on [[House Matfey]] and their members were executed. There remains doubt if they were the true culprits or merely a scapegoat.
