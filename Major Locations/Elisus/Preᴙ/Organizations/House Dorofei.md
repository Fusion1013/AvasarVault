# Overview
House Dorofei is a noble house from [[Preᴙ Overview|Preᴙ]], operating primarily out of [[Wrᴎgord]]. This noble family has its roots since before the [[So'Dar Empire Overview|So'Dar]] war, making it one of the oldest, still intact, bloodlines. They are one of the most powerful houses within the nation, holding major positions within the Preᴙ government. More recently, the family's position has become threatened. Internal conflicts have escalated over the past few years, giving other houses an opportunity to grasp at power.
# History
// TODO

The recent [[1374 APC - Tamerian Tragedy|Tamerian Tragedy]] marked a major power shift within the family, resulting in [[Aleks Dorofei]] coming to power, something that was not popular with other branches of the family. The tragedy took place in 1374 APC during a ball with multiple high-ranking noble houses. Top members of House Dorofei were in attendance and were subsequently all poisoned to death, together with most of the other attendees. After this, [[Aleks Dorofei]] swiftly rose to power, vowing to find those responsible. Eventually the tragedy was blamed on [[House Matfey]] and their members were executed. There remains doubt if they were the true culprits or merely a scapegoat.
# Family Values & Traits
[[House Dorofei]] values order and tradition above all else. As they are one of the oldest noble houses, dating back to before the coup that turned [[Preᴙ Overview|Preᴙ]] into what it is today, they still cling to some of the values and traditions from back in those days. Because of this, they often have disagreements with some of the younger and more progressive noble families, for example [[House Vikentiv]].

For a long time [[House Dorofei]] ideals have been representative of [[Preᴙ Overview|Preᴙ]] as a whole, though this has changed during more recent years. Recent events have shown that [[Preᴙ Overview|Preᴙs]] conservative ideals have caused them to fall behind the rest of the world both in terms of technological and societal progress, they are now seen as a relic of a past kingdom to the rest of the world. Because of this, people have started to look towards other houses to lead them that showcase more progressive ideals.
# Power & Influence
## Government
[[House Dorofei]] have almost complete control of the nations military. They have people in the leadership of all branches of military, the city guard, and even supposedly private protection businesses that have a hand in protecting the other noble families. This is a big part of why they have managed to stay in power for as long as they have. Their military strength and influence has historically helped them forcibly shut down any opposition whenever necessary, though this is a power that they exercise with caution as they know the people dislike these practices. Most of the time, the mere threat of an intervention is enough to stave off any political threat. The military powers have seen more use recently however, since [[Aleks Dorofei]] came to power.

They also occupy a majority of the seats on the city council in [[Wrᴎgord]], giving them massive influence over policymaking and the politics of the entire nation.
