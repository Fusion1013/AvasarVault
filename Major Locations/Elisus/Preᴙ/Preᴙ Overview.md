# History
Preᴙ was originally known as the Preᴙ Kingdom, and used to occupy a much larger portion of land than it does now. It has been forced to shrink its borders multiple times over the past centuries, due to both conflicts and environmental disasters. It originally formed from a [[The Wandering Hoards|Wandering Hoard]] that originated from the northern parts of the continent and settled in the area. The leader of the hoard became the king of this new kingdom. The kingdom came to occupy a large amount of the coastal areas where the [[Fracrish Mountains]] now are.

The original capital was [[Zhᴎmchug]], and was located on the north-western coast of the kingdom. In 1157 APC a border dispute escalated into a war with the [[So'Dar Empire Overview|So'Dar Empire]]. This war continued for 12 years, until the [[Island of Taundor]] was smashed into the northern coast of Preᴙ, causing much of the kingdom to descend into chaos. This event caused massive flooding and earthquakes. A group of nobles took advantage of this and made a deal with [[So'Dar Empire Overview|So'Dar]]. The nobles staged a coup to take control of the Preᴙ military and pulled it back to the city of [[Wrᴎgord]]. This left the capital vulnerable leading to it being taken over by the [[So'Dar Empire Overview|So'Dar Nation]] in 1169 APC and subsequently renamed to [[Dawnfrei]]. In exchange for this, the nobles were allowed to keep the area surrounding [[Wrᴎgord]].

The nation is now only known as Preᴙ and is run by an oligarchy of nobles, all belonging to a handful of [[Preᴙ Overview#Noble Houses|Noble Houses]].

# Factions
Various factions have their roots in Preᴙ.
## Noble Houses
### House Dorofei
This noble family has its roots since before the [[So'Dar Empire Overview|So'Dar]] war, making it one of the oldest, still intact, bloodlines. They are one of the most powerful houses within the nation, holding major positions within the Preᴙ treasury. More recently, the family's position has become threatened. Internal conflicts have escalated over the past few years, giving other houses an opportunity to grasp at power.

The recent Tamerian Tragedy marked a major power shift within the family, resulting in [[Aleks Dorofei]] coming to power, something that was not popular with other branches of the family. The tragedy took place in 1374 during a ball with multiple high-ranking noble houses. Top members of House Dorofei were in attendance and were subsequently all poisoned to death, together with most of the other attendees. After this, [[Aleks Dorofei]] swiftly rose to power, vowing to find those responsible. Eventually the tragedy was blamed on House Matfey and their members executed. There remains doubt if they were the true culprits or merely a scapegoat.
### House Gerasim
Founded by [[Vlad Gerasim]] and [[Natalya Savva]] in 1332 APC. [[Vlad Gerasim|Vlad]] was originally a member of [[Preᴙ Overview#House Dorofei|House Dorofei]], but decided to take his mothers name and form his own house after some issues within the family. Most of the family now lives in a [[small city]] in the countryside, not too far from the capital. They mainly work within the logging industry. They have an ongoing feud with [[Preᴙ Overview#House Dorofei|House Dorofei]] due to their history, with both trying to undermine the others affairs. [[Preᴙ Overview#House Dorofei|House Dorofei]] has blocked House Gerasim wood trade to the capital, cutting off an important part of their business.
### House Vikentiv
One of the younger but more powerful noble houses. They control a lot of the major trade routes, making them one of the more influential houses within the nation. They are currently making moves to take control of the capital from [[Preᴙ Overview#House Dorofei|House Dorofei]].
### House Terenti
House Terenti is quite a large house that occupies various minor positions within the government, and have managed to stay relevant within higher circles through strategic marriages. They have been close allies with [[Preᴙ Overview#House Dorofei|House Dorofei]] for quite some time, giving them a foothold on the country's finances.
