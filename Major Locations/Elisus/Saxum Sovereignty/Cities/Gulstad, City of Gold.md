*"Where Craftsmanship meets Prosperity"*
# Overview
Gulstad is the capital of the [[Saxum Sovereignty Overview|Saxum Sovereignty]]. It is the nation's center of trade, hence the nickname “City of Gold”. Its main exports are various goods made from rare metals, extracted from the nearby mountains. The city is known for its skilled artisans, and their wares are highly sought after across the continents.

The city holds a circular shape, with three layers of ringed walls protecting the inner spire that make up the bulk upper part of the city. The entire city is not visible however, as a large portion of it extends far underground, through a series of large tunnels.
# History
Gulstad was [[1181 APC - Gulstad Founding|founded in 1181 APC]]. It was the first city within Saxum and later became the official capital of the nation. It was founded as the first safe haven for practitioners of magic that were seeking to escape the [[Turochan Kingdom Overview|Turochan Kingdom]].
# Landmarks
## The Tower
The Tower refers to the large, central spire that stretches above and below the city. It forms the main parts of the city.
### Underground City
The Tower does not just tower above the surrounding landscape. The spire extends even further down below ground. Stretching into subterranean tunnels that form a vast underground network. This lower district is where most common folk in the city live. This lower part of the city is known as the [[Gulstad, City of Gold#The Twilight District|Twilight District]].
## The Twilight District
*"Welcome to the playground"*

The Twilight District is located deep beneath the city. It is where most of the common population of the city resides.
### Magical Light
The Twilight District is lit up primarily by magical light sources that have been affixed to the walls and ceilings.
### Mushroom & Lichen Farming
As most of the city’s food is gathered from surrounding farms, the city could easily be starved by above ground attacks cutting off the city’s supply of food. To protect against this there are currently experiments being conducted by [[The Agronomi Institute]] focused on growing food from underground mushrooms. There are a few mushroom caves set up deep within the city. The main focus of the experiments is how to grow the mushrooms efficiently, and how to create food out of it that would cover the basic needs of a living creature.

While attempting some of these experiments they accidentally created the [[Mýkites Overview#Hikseta|Hikseta]], a new type of sentient mushroom race. They attempted to discard these failed experiments, but instead the [[Mýkites Overview#Hikseta|Hikseta]] thrived, forming a mushroom society deep below the city.
### The King's Grave
<span class="rightimg"><span class="smallimg"> ![[KingsCrypt.jpg|180]] </span></span>*"Forget what must be remembered"*

Far beneath the bustling streets and towering spires of the city lies a somber place of remembrance known as the King’s Grave. This macabre monument serves as a testament to the harrowing history of the Saxum, who endured the hatred of their old people in the aftermath of the cataclysm that shattered their homeland. Here, the past is interred in the deepest, darkest depths, never to be seen or spoken of again, a symbol of the Saxum’s seething anger and resentment towards the new king and his nation. For the Saxum, the King’s Grave is a place of mourning and bitter acceptance, a stark reminder of all they have lost and all that is now forever dead and buried.
## Dragon Port
The main headquarters of [[Gulstad, City of Gold#Skywing Transport|Skywing Transport]]. It provides transportation to the other side of the Dragonback Mountains and up to [[Odverg, City of Metal|Odverg]].
# Defenses
There are three layers of ringed walls surrounding the city. There are eight smaller towers spread along the outermost wall with arcane cannons stationed on top. The inner walls have towers of their own with catapults on top of them. There are two armored gates that lead into the inner rings, one on each side of the city.

Since most of the city is located underground it is well protected from airborne attacks. A significant amount of time has been spent trying to protect the [[Gulstad, City of Gold#The Twilight District|Twilight District]] from underground attacks, such as large worms or similar creatures. While the outermost tunnels have been reinforced with steel, they are still vulnerable to attacks by a persistent foe. To aid in the defenses of these tunnels, most of them have [[Shadow Lantern|Shadow Lanterns]] attached to the walls that can be activated either in sections or all at once by the guard captains.

The city guards can be recognized by their black plate mail, with high rank being indicated by strips of gold filigree on their helmets. Most of the city guards have some knowledge of the arcane, but there are a few groups that specialize in different kinds of magic.

At the top of the city are the massive searchlights that aid the city during times of battle. They were massively helpful during the [[1276 APC - Invasion of Saxum]] in helping locate air threats and subsequently shooting them down with the arcane cannons positioned at the top of the tower.
# Organizations
## The Saxum Triumvirate
[[The Saxum Triumvirate]] is composed of three powerful mages who rule over the Saxum Sovereignty from within the tower. They are [[Archmage Heinrich Bodenheimer]], [[Master Leopold Krauszer]], and [[Renate von Abendroth]]. As the ruling body of the nation, they hold ultimate power over all aspects of governance and policy, though they are advised by a council of 13 representatives from different regions of the country. [[The Saxum Triumvirate|The Triumvirate]] is known for their formidable magical abilities and their unwavering commitment to Saxum and its prosperity.
## Skywing Transport
*"Trust your cargo to the strength of our dragons"*

Skywing Transport was created to be a solution to the difficult problem of transporting goods across the [[Dragonback Mountains]]. Since dragons are intelligent creatures they do not need riders, though they sometimes take passengers through the use of specially constructed carrier vessels.
