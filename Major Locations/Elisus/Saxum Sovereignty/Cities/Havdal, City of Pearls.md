# Overview
Havdal is the largest port city within the [[Saxum Sovereignty Overview|Saxum Sovereignty]], with its main exports being various crafted goods made from metal, as well as large amounts of food products.
# History
Havdal was established in [[1186 APC - Havdal Founding|1186 APC]] and quickly grew into the most prominent port city in the nation. It became an important part of establishing the nation and promoting trade with other nearby regions, such as the [[Ohkyr Dominion Overview|Ohkyr Dominion]] and [[City-State of Drufali Overview|The City-State of Drufali]].
## Invasion of Saxum
The city was hit hard during the [[1276 APC - Invasion of Saxum|Invasion of Saxum]], and quickly fell to the [[Ohkyr Dominion Overview|Ohkyr Dominion]]. Marks from this time still remain to this day, with a substantial part of the western city still undergoing reparations. Since the invasion Havdal has seen a heavy increase in the defense department, with more spending going towards building warships and reinforcing the outer seawalls.
# Landmarks
## Skaldvik Wharf
The bustling heart of Havdal's harbor, filled with piers, warehouses, and trade ships from across the region. The docks are known for their distinctive, colorful banners representing the major trade guilds of the city. A section of docks, called *Refuge Pier*, is dedicated to small fishing vessels and local traders.
## The Sentinel Spire
A towering lighthouse built on the easternmost tip of Havdal's coastline. It serves as a beacon for incoming ships, guiding them into port. The base of the spire was partially damaged during the invasion, with scorch marks and shattered stone. It also houses a museum in the basement, detailing Havdal's naval history and the Invasion of Saxum.
## The Ironworks Bazaar
A sprawling market district at the heart of Havdal where crafted goods made of metal and gemstones are displayed and traded. Blacksmiths, jewelers, and artisans from all over Saxum showcase their intricate weapons, armor, jewelry, and tools. A massive statue of an ironclad ship on top of a fountain holds the center of the area.
## The Iron Drakkar Shipyard
This shipyard is responsible for producing merchant vessels and warships. Visitors can witness the construction process of massive, iron-plated warships from afar, though no outsiders are allowed inside the area.

Just outside the area is a decommissioned battleship, The Unyielding Tide, docked. It is now used as a museum ship, its decks lined with displays of objects and relics from battles fought at sea.
## Temple of Merstur
This grand temple is dedicated to [[Merstur, the Unbroken Tide]], the god of the weather and seas. It serves as a place of worship for merchants and sailors, with an interior decorated with mosaics depicting the seas. Offerings of coins, crafted goods, and food are left here before major voyages.
# Defenses
Havdal's defensive network is a response to the devastation caused by the [[1276 APC - Invasion of Saxum|Invasion of Saxum in 1276 APC]]. These measures were taken to ensure the city's safety in the face of such an attack, with a focus on repelling future attacks from both sea and land. Below is a detailed account of its key defensive features.
## Warships
Havdal's navy, known as the **Iron Drakkar**, is a key part of the city's defense. These warships are designed for both speed and durability, capable of engaging enemy vessels far from the city or defending the harbor itself.

The fleet features a variety of different ship types, each designed with a specific goal in mind.
### Ironclads
The pride of Havdal's navy. These heavily-armored ships are equipped with reinforced hulls and weaponry. They feature onboard ballistae and trebuchets for long distance attacks. Some of them even feature experimental arcane cannons, capable of higher fire-power, but longer recharge times.

Due to their reinforced hull they are heavier than other ships, and therefore slower and much more difficult to manoeuvre.
### Longships
Sleeker and faster than the Ironclads. Primarily used for scouting, quick attacks, and transporting soldiers.
### Fire Ships
Specialized vessels packed with alchemical fire. Used as suicide ships to ram and ignite the enemy ships. Deployed as a last resort to sow chaos during an invasion.
### Merchant Escorts
Lighter warships designed to protect the city's vital trade routes. Usually armed with small cannons to deter pirates or smaller enemy fleets. Designed for high speeds and manoeuvrability.
## Outer Seawall
The seawall is a massive structure of stone and iron, stretching in a crescent shape around the harbor. Its outer surface is lined with boulders to absorb the force of waves and discourage ramming ships, while the top is flat and wide, serving as a platform for soldiers and siege weaponry. Rising some 12 feet above the surface of the waterline and extending 20 feet below, the wall is designed to deter even the largest of enemy ships. It is reinforced with layers of iron plating to resist enemy cannon fire.

At regular intervals along the seawall, **defensive towers** rise another 30 feet. Each tower is equipped with ballistae for firing massive bolts capable of piercing the hulls of enemy ships. Some towers are also equipped with catapults, capable of launching fiery projectiles or heavy stones at approaching vessels.
# Organizations
## The Steelwright's Guild
One of Havdal's oldest and most influential organizations. Consisting of blacksmiths, armorers, and artisans, the guild oversees the crafting of everything from delicate metal ornaments to the steel plating of the city's warships.
## The Brotherhood of the Anchor
The organization responsible for maintaining order in Havdal's bustling harbor and its waters. Acting as a mix of naval guard and privateer hunters. They ensure that trade flows smoothly and enforce maritime law.

Their base of operations is a tower overlooking the harbor, adorned with massive iron anchors from old ships. Their officers carry a distinctive badge shaped like a ship's wheel.
## The Saltbound Consortium
The largest merchant organization in the city. They control much of the trade flowing in and out of Hadal. Its members consist of wealthy traders, shipbuilders, and influential dockmasters. While their primary goal is profit, they also play a significant role in the city's politics and infrastructure development.
