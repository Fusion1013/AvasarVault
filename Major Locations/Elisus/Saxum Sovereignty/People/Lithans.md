# Appearance
Lithans usually have skin tones that range from warm beige to almond hues. Their eyes are usually brown or green. Hair colors have a wide range from light to almost black.

# Religion
A lot of Lithans are atheists, believing more in their own abilities than trusting the gods. These beliefs stem back to their perceived betrayal of [[Irellia, Mistress of the Tranquil Lake]] during the destruction of their previous homeland.

Some religious folk can still be found, but those are usually along the coast where other [[Culture|Cultures]] have had influence on the people living there. For example, [[Havdal, City of Pearls]] have a few temples dedicated to different deities that hold dominion over the sea.
