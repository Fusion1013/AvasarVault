# Overview
Kvistrfjord is an isolated village nestled on the banks of the winding Elv River, in the heart of [[Saxum Sovereignty Overview|Saxum]]'s northern wooded area. The town was originally founded by settlers from [[Fjellfot, City of Rock]], that travelled along the river and settled in the area some 150 years ago. Kvistrfjord grew around a narrow bend in the river, where natural barriers made it an ideal place for defense. The area is suitable for trade due to the river connecting the village to both [[Fjellfot, City of Rock]] and [[Havdal, City of Pearls]]. They eventually developed a sustainable economy based on woodcraft, and a rare [[Ironwood]] tree that grows only in this area of [[Saxum Sovereignty Overview|Saxum]].
