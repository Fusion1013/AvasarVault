# Overview
Kvistrfjord is an isolated village nestled on the banks of the winding Elv River, in the heart of [[Saxum Sovereignty Overview|Saxum]]'s northern wooded area. The town was originally founded by settlers from [[Fjellfot, City of Rock]], that travelled along the river and settled in the area some 150 years ago. Kvistrfjord grew around a narrow bend in the river, where natural barriers made it an ideal place for defense. The area is suitable for trade due to the river connecting the village to both [[Fjellfot, City of Rock]] and [[Havdal, City of Pearls]]. They eventually developed a sustainable economy based on woodcraft, and a rare [[Ironwood]] tree that grows only in this area of [[Saxum Sovereignty Overview|Saxum]].
# Landmarks
## The Black Grove
There is a dense cluster of ironwood trees on the edge of the village. The denizens of the village believe a spirit named Yrnolfr inhabits these woods. They have built a stone shrine here to honor Yrnolfr, leaving offerings of carvings, small effigies, and other crafted objects of devotion, to appease the spirit. Legends tell of strange whispers and flickering lights among the trees, with many claiming that Yrnolfr watches over the grove and provides safety to those within it.
## Elv River Docks
A modest wooden dock on the river Elv, connecting Kvistrfjord to major trading hubs such as [[Havdal, City of Pearls|Havdal]] and [[Fjellfot, City of Rock|Fjellfot]].
## The Old Watchtower
A crumbling stone watchtower sits on a nearby hill, a remnant from the days Saxum sent soldiers to protect the smaller town. Now it has fallen into disuse.
## The Ironwood Workshop
This workshop is run by **Brynjar Stoneshaper**, the village's master craftsman. He is known for creating exquisite weapon hafts, bows, and tools from [[Ironwood]].
