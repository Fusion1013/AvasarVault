# Overview
The Choir is the sacred blade of the [[Ohkyr Dominion Overview|Ohkyr Dominion]]'s navy, an elite order within [[The Sanctified Host]]. Its members fill various roles within the organizations, from consecrated warriors to high priests of the ocean gods.

This group has the power to plan and perform missions without oversight from the [[The Grand Synod of Ohkyr|Synod]].

Only the devout, the exceptional, and the fearless rise to join their ranks. Among them, myth and discipline converge. And when their banners catch the wind and their psalms echo across the sea, the world remembers: the gods have not forgotten how to make war.
