# Overview
The Choir is the sacred blade of the [[Ohkyr Dominion Overview|Ohkyr Dominion]]'s navy, an elite order within [[The Sanctified Host]]. Its members fill various roles within the organizations, from consecrated warriors to high priests.

This group has the power to plan and perform missions without oversight from the [[The Grand Synod of Ohkyr|Synod]]. They fill an important role within the nations government, by acting as a check on the [[The Grand Synod of Ohkyr|Synod]]. They have the power to perform investigations into members of the [[The Grand Synod of Ohkyr|Synod]], uncovering any potential corruption, without oversight from the [[The Grand Synod of Ohkyr|Synod]] itself. However, they do not have the power to remove potentially corrupt members, and have to rely on the [[The Grand Synod of Ohkyr|Synod]] using the information they provide.

Only the devout, the exceptional, and the fearless rise to join the ranks of [[The Choir]]. Among them, myth and discipline converge. And when their banners catch the wind and their psalms echo across the sea, the world remembers: the gods have not forgotten how to make war.
