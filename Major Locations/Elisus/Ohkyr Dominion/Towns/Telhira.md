The town is old, lots of older style buildings. It has recently seen more development though. They have started expanding the docks to allow for more ships to dock. Renovations are taking place around the city.

Reason for this recent activity? Did they find something in the area? Why is the town becoming relevant now?
- Maybe some noble person has come here with mysterious intentions, employing people, reshaping the town

How have these activities affected the town? What do people in the town think about it?

The towns' name roughly translates to **Waveborn Haven** in [[Th√ºma]].
# History
The history of [[Telhira]] goes far back, to before the founding of the [[Ohkyr Dominion Overview|Ohkyr Dominion]]. It is believed that the town is built on the same ground as the first settlement on this continent, with ruins and artefacts found dating back to before the [[0APC - Planar Concordance|Planar Concordance]].

The town itself was originally founded somewhere around [[170 APC]]. It was originally built as an outpost for [[Velmira, City of Watchful Waters|Velmira]], but quickly grew into a small town. It was built along the cliffs, as a means of protecting the town from land borne threats. A small wall was built along the ocean, remnants of which can still be seen today.

The town saw difficulties during the founding years of the [[Ohkyr Dominion Overview|Ohkyr Dominion]]. Resources and troops were shifted away from the town to support the solidification of [[Velmira, City of Watchful Waters|Velmira]] as an important part of the new nation. As a result, the town was abandoned. It was not until [[530 APC]] that eyes again shifted towards the west and the town began to see restoration efforts. It was repurposed into a staging ground for expeditions out towards the north-west, towards the island of [[Taundor]]. The town slowly grew into a small city.

Disaster struck in [[1167APC - Taundor Cataclysm|1167APC]], when the island of [[Taundor]] smashed into the continent. Earthquakes wracked the area, causing parts of the cliff to sunder and crush large parts of the city. It was once again abandoned, with the residents evacuating to [[Velmira, City of Watchful Waters|Velmira]].

Restoration efforts did not begin until
