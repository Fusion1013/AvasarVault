The town is old, lots of older style buildings. It has recently seen more development though. They have started expanding the docks to allow for more ships to dock. Renovations are taking place around the city.

Reason for this recent activity? Did they find something in the area? Why is the town becoming relevant now?
- Maybe some noble person has come here with mysterious intentions, employing people, reshaping the town

How have these activities affected the town? What do people in the town think about it?

The towns' name roughly translates to **Waveborn Haven** in [[Th√ºma]].
