# History
The history of [[Telhira]] goes far back, to before the founding of the [[Ohkyr Dominion Overview|Ohkyr Dominion]]. It is believed that the town is built on the same ground as the first settlement on this continent, with ruins and artefacts found dating back to before the [[0APC - Planar Concordance|Planar Concordance]].

The town itself was originally founded somewhere around [[170 APC]]. It was initially built as an outpost for [[Velmira, City of Watchful Waters|Velmira]], but settlers and traders quickly followed. It was built along the cliffs, as a means of protecting the town from land borne threats. A small wall was built along the ocean, remnants of which can still be seen today.

The town saw difficulties during the founding years of the [[Ohkyr Dominion Overview|Ohkyr Dominion]]. Resources and troops were shifted away from the town to support the solidification of [[Velmira, City of Watchful Waters|Velmira]] as an important part of the new nation. As a result, the town was abandoned. It was not until [[530 APC]] that eyes again shifted towards the west and the town began to see restoration efforts. It was repurposed into a staging ground for expeditions out towards the north-west, towards the island of [[Taundor]]. The town slowly grew into a small city.

Disaster struck in [[1167APC - Taundor Cataclysm|1167APC]], when the island of [[Taundor]] smashed into the continent. Earthquakes wracked the area, causing parts of the cliff to sunder and crush large parts of the city. Parts of the city sunk into the sea, disappearing below the churning waves. It was once again abandoned, with the residents evacuating to [[Velmira, City of Watchful Waters|Velmira]].

Earthquakes continued to wrack the area for years to follow. Restoration efforts could not begin until over 50 years later, in [[1202APC]]. Even then, progress was slow. People were hesitant to return to the area due to superstition and worry that the earthquakes would return, something the town was vulnerable to due to the tall cliffs.

Today, the town is but a shadow of its former self. The seawall still lay in ruins, the west side of the town lies in ruin from a landslide. The town only started seeing real progress in recent years, with a noble moving his business here, starting the process of building up the town.
# Geography
The town is surrounded on all sides by bush-covered hills. The [[Dragonback Mountains]] loom not far to the west. The land surrounding the city is scarred and cracked due to earthquakes caused by the [[1167APC - Taundor Cataclysm|Taundor Cataclysm]]. Deep chasms split the land closer to the mountains. Small, narrow islands dot the coastline, formed when the land was displaced.
# Landmarks
## The Docks

## Cliffside
## Chapel of Irellia
A half submerged chapel on the outskirts of the city. It used to be dedicated to [[Irellia - Mistress of the Tranquil Lake|Irellia]], but was desecrated and abandoned after the [[1167APC - Taundor Cataclysm|Cataclysm]]. It is now used by a fringe religious group that worships [[Irellia - Mistress of the Tranquil Lake|Irellia]] out of fear of her rage.
## Lighthouse
There is a small lighthouse built out on a cliff a few hundred meters off shore. The light went out years ago.
