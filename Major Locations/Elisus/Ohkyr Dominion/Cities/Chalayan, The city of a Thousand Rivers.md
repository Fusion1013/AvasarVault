*"From the heights of Chalayan, the world bows to the sea. Tread carefully, for even the winds here serve the gods."
— **Sister Relian**, Pilgrim of the Azure Order*
# Overview
The city of Chalayan is situated on a large cliff overlooking the ocean. It is a bustling port city with grand temples dedicated to the gods of the pantheon. Intricate marble buildings climb the cliffs towards the ocean, colorful banners with patterns of the different gods fly in the wind. The capital is home to a number of marketplaces where sailors and merchants from around the world converge. The city gets the nickname "The City of a Thousand Rivers" from the numerous underground rivers located in and around the city region.
# History
## The Siege of the Hall (764 APC)
This historic event was the first time [[The Grand Synod of Ohkyr]] was besieged internally. This was able to occur due to [[Chancellor Denek]]'s attempted power grab. Even today, a crimson stained pillar stands in the Hall's lower courtyard where many defenders fell.
## The Silent Storm (1012 APC)
Large parts of the southern cliff collapsed during a particularly violent storm, threatening to destroy The Hall of Echoes. When the storm passed however, the Hall remained untouched, despite the surrounding devastation. Many have attributed the Halls survival to the gods, with some claiming it was a test of faith, and that the Synod had proven its loyalty.
# Geography
The city is built upon a large cliff overlooking the ocean. At the cliff's foot, multiple cave openings open into a series of natural underground rivers.
# Landmarks
## The Hall of Echoes
This is where [[The Grand Synod of Ohkyr]] meets. The Hall of Echoes is a massive citadel built into the cliffside of [[Chalayan, The city of a Thousand Rivers|Chalayan]]. Its grand seaward façade is shaped like a massive split helm; one side carved to resemble crashing waves, the other a jagged blade of stone. The halls are constructed in such a way that the sound of the waves reverberates throughout the structure, filling it with a constant, ghostly chorus that locals believe to be the whispers of [[Merstur - the Unbroken Tide|Merstur]] and [[Ogrun - the Scarlet Champion|Ogrun]] themselves.

The hall was constructed during the 2nd century after the [[0APC - Planar Concordance|Planar Concordance]], as a symbol of unity in this newly formed nation of [[Ohkyr Dominion Overview|Ohkyr]]. Construction of the massive building took 23 years and the combined work of thousands of artisans, mages, and prisoners of wars to complete it. Legends say that the design for the citadel was given to [[High Priest Varlen of the Shattered River]] in a joint vision from [[Merstur - the Unbroken Tide|Merstur]] and [[Ogrun - the Scarlet Champion|Ogrun]].

## Docks District
There are multiple smaller docks located in and around the bottom of the tall cliffs that [[Chalayan, The city of a Thousand Rivers|Chalayan]] is built upon. There are three larger docks that are primarily owned and operated by [[The Sanctified Host]]. This is also where the main headquarters for [[The Choir]] is rumoured to be located, though its exact location is unknown.
## Underground Rivers
There are a large number of rivers running from the ocean, through the cliffs that the city rests on, and passing into various underground cave networks. There are rumors of sections of river that extend far past the outer city walls. These tunnels have historically been a prime location for various smuggling operations to take place, though even the church uses them to transport goods from and to secret underground entrances.
## Grand Lift of Serkan
Constructed directly into the coastal cliff, the Grand Lift of Serkan is a marvel of engineering. It is a testament to the genius of its namesake, the famed priest-engineer Serkan the Devout. The lift forms a vertical shaft framed in obsidian and inlaid with [[Transcendental Bronze]]. The shaft itself features beautiful verses and iconography taken from the [[Canticles of Descent]], prayers meant to protect all who travel Chalayan.

The platform itself is a massive, open chamber of marble floors, stained glass windows, and arched pillars of steel.

The lift is powered by a combination of hydraulics and arcane ingenuity. Hydraulic pressure generated from one of the underground rivers drives massive pistons. At the core, a slow-turning gear mechanism inlaid with arcane runes, regulates ascent and descent.

The lift is commonly used to transport both people and goods. However access is strictly regulated, and the lift only operates during set times of day.
