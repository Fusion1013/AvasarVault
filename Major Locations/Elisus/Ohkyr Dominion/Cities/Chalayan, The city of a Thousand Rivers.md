# Overview
The city of Chalayan is situated on a large cliff overlooking the ocean. It is a bustling port city with grand temples dedicated to the gods of the pantheon. Intricate marble buildings climb the cliffs towards the ocean, colorful banners with patterns of the different gods fly in the wind. The capital is home to a number of marketplaces where sailors and merchants from around the world converge. The city gets the nickname "The City of a Thousand Rivers" from the numerous underground rivers located in and around the city region.
# History

# Landmarks
## Docks District
There are multiple smaller docks located in and around the bottom of the tall cliffs that [[Chalayan, The city of a Thousand Rivers|Chalayan]] is built upon. There are three larger docks that are primarily owned and operated by [[The Sanctified Host]]. This is also where the main headquarters for [[The Choir]] is rumoured to be located, though its exact location is unknown.
## Underground Rivers
There are a large number of rivers running from the ocean, through the cliffs that the city rests on, and passing into various underground cave networks. These tunnels have historically been a prime location for various smuggling operations to take place, though even the church uses them to transport goods from and to secret underground entrances.
## Grand Lift of Serkan
Constructed directly into the coastal cliff, the Grand Lift of Serkan is a marvel of engineering. It is a testament to the genius of its namesake, the famed priest-engineer Serkan the Devout. The lift forms a vertical shaft framed in obsidian and inlaid with [[Transcendental Bronze]]. The shaft itself features beautiful verses and iconography taken from the [[Canticles of Descent]], prayers meant to protect all who travel Chalayan.

The platform itself is a massive, open chamber of marble floors, stained glass windows, and arched pillars of steel.

The lift is powered by a combination of hydraulics and arcane ingenuity. Hydraulic pressure generated from one of the underground rivers drives massive pistons. At the core, a slow-turning gear mechanism inlaid with arcane runes, regulates ascent and descent.

The lift is commonly used to transport both people and goods. However access is strictly regulated, and the lift only operates during set times of day.
