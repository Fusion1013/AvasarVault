# Overview
Velmira is located where the wide river known as the [[Silver Vein]] spreads into a broad, slow-moving estuary. The city is built upon the small islands that dot the area, connecting them ornate bridges of white stone. The river is considered sacred, and many shrines dot its banks. Velmira is home to the [[Ohkyr Dominion Overview|Dominion]]'s most prestigious academies. The city has an air of mystery to it, the quiet twin to [[Chalayan, The city of a Thousand Rivers|Chalayan]]'s bustling energy.
# History
## Merchant Rebellion (1121 APC)
In [[1121 APC]] the local merchant lords of the city, angered by the [[The Grand Synod of Ohkyr|Synod]] strict trade regulations and high taxes, sought to seize control of the city. They allied with pirate fleets that had ravaged the area a few years prior, promising them vast riches in return. Velmira's vulnerable location made it an easy target: scattered islands, countless winding canals, and little to no fortifications.
# Geography
Estuarine marshes and winding waterways dominate the landscape, splitting it into many smaller islands. Many of the buildings have been constructed on pylons.
# Landmarks
## Temple of Shifting Waters
An old temple dedicated to [[Merstur - the Unbroken Tide|Merstur]] built close to where the river joins with the ocean. During high tide the temple partially floods, making accessible only during high tide.
