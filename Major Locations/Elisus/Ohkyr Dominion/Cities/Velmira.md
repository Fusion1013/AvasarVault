# Overview
Velmira is located where the wide river known as the [[Silver Vein]] spreads into a broad, slow-moving estuary. The city is built upon the small islands that dot the area, connecting them ornate bridges of white stone. The river is considered sacred, and many shrines dot its banks. Velmira is home to the [[Ohkyr Dominion Overview|Dominion]]'s most prestigious academies. The city has an air of mystery to it, the quiet twin to [[Chalayan, The city of a Thousand Rivers|Chalayan]]'s bustling energy.
