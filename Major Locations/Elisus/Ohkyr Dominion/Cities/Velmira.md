# Overview
Velmira is located where the wide river known as the [[Silver Vein]] spreads into a broad, slow-moving estuary. The city is built upon the small islands that dot the area, connecting them ornate bridges of white stone. The river is considered sacred, and many shrines dot its banks. Velmira is home to the [[Ohkyr Dominion Overview|Dominion]]'s most prestigious academies. The city has an air of mystery to it, the quiet twin to [[Chalayan, The city of a Thousand Rivers|Chalayan]]'s bustling energy.
# History
## Religious Rebellion (1121 APC)
In [[1121 APC]] a local religious group staged a rebellion to take control of the city. They were angered by the [[The Grand Synod of Ohkyr|Synod]]'s strict religious oversight, and wanted more religions to be officially recognized. They allied with pirate fleets that had ravaged the area a few years prior, promising them vast riches in return. Velmira's vulnerable location made it an easy target: scattered islands, countless winding canals, and little to no fortifications. Their goal was to drive the [[The Grand Synod of Ohkyr|Synod]]'s forces away from the city by attacking key locations, including the harbour and the guard headquarters.

During the attack, pirate ships swarmed the estuary, quickly taking control of the largest harbour.

Eventually the [[Tidecallers]] of the city were able to repel the attack, but the city suffered heavy losses.
# Geography
Estuarine marshes and winding waterways dominate the landscape, splitting it into many smaller islands. Many of the buildings have been constructed on pylons.
# Landmarks
## Temple of Shifting Waters
An old temple dedicated to [[Merstur - the Unbroken Tide|Merstur]] built close to where the river joins with the ocean. During high tide the temple partially floods, making accessible only during high tide.
# Organizations
# Local Traditions
There are many traditions and rites relating to the history the city has with the river and the spirits that dwell there.
## Festival of Remembrance
This day is dedicated to remembering the many lives that were lost during the attack in [[1121 APC]]. During this day, thousands of colorful paper boats are constructed and floated down the river. The festival takes place during the first week of [[Verra]].
