# Overview
Selvarin is an older priest, and something of a living relic. He was born during [[The Great Moonfall Storm]], and some believe he was touched by [[Merstur - the Unbroken Tide|Merstur]] at birth. He is a traditionalist, believing in strictly following the established traditions and opposing any change. He often preaches the patience of the sea, and opposes unnecessary expansion. He has served on [[The Grand Synod of Ohkyr]] as the [[The Grand Synod of Ohkyr#1. Archpontiff of Merstur|Archpontiff of Merstur]] for over 30 years.
