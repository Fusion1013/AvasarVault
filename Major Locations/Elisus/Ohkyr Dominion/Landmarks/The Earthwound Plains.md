# Overview
The region at the foot of the [[Dragonback Mountains]] are known as [[The Earthwound Plains]]. This is the region that was hit the hardest during the [[1167APC - Taundor Cataclysm|Taundor Cataclysm]]. Large cracks span the plains here, like deep wounds in the flesh of the earth. Earthquakes still plague the area, making permanent construction difficult.
# Geography
The largest ravines stretch down to below sea level, hundreds of meters down from the surface. The bottom of a lot of them are flooded, making traversal difficult. The width of the ravines varies from thin ones spanning a few meters, to massive ones of up to 50 meters in width.

Plant life on the surface is sparse, with little to no forests. Low bushes dot the area and thin-bladed grass grows in splotchy patches along the ground. Trees grow in some of the shallower ravines, where water can gather.
# Structures
Ruins from some old [[Ohkyr Dominion Overview|Ohkyr]] cities can be found dotting the landscape, both on the land above and in some of the ravines.

A maintained highway runs through the region, linking the [[Ohkyr Dominion Overview|Ohkyr Dominion]] and the [[Saxum Sovereignty Overview|Saxum Sovereignty]]. The highway winds across the region, seeking thinner ravines that are easier to cross using permanent bridges.
