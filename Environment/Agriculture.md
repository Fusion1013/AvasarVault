# Introduction
Due to the long year, agriculture on Avasar has had to adopt to the harsh environments. While long summers create ample opportunities for growing crops, the harsh and long winters can cause severe famine if not prepared for properly.

Different areas have developed different methods for coping with these environmental challenges. For area specific solutions to these issues, refer to the [[Agriculture#Regions|Regions]] section below.
# Evolution of Crops & Plants
A lot of the crops and plants on Avasar have evolved to have a long growth period, allowing for extensive growths and large yields. Due to the long year a lot of plants have had to adapt to survive the long winters. They do this by storing water in the stems, roots, etc during the summers. Then, during winters, they stop growing to preserve energy.

During this time they can also use the stored water in order to protect their cells. Some plants do this by shifting water to the surface of the skin, allowing it to form ice crystals there. This results in the insides of the cells becoming dehydrated and very syrupy with dissolved substances that act as a sort of antifreeze, protecting the cell from freezing and dying. Then, when the weather gets warmer, the plant can quickly shift water back into the cells to resume metabolic processes and protect against desiccation.

Other plants that do not need to survive through the winter instead drop their seeds, which have much lower moisture and are either in the soil or under the snow, which keeps them from getting damaged from the cold.
