# Introduction
Due to the long year, agriculture on Avasar has had to adopt to the harsh environments. While long summers create ample opportunities for growing crops, the harsh and long winters can cause severe famine if not prepared for properly.

Different areas have developed different methods for coping with these environmental challenges. For area specific solutions to these issues, refer to the [[Agriculture#Regions|Regions]] section below.
# Evolution of Crops & Plants
A lot of the crops and plants on Avasar have evolved to have a long growth period, allowing for extensive growths and large yields. Due to the long year a lot of plants have had to adapt to survive the long winters. They do this by storing water in the stems, roots, etc during the summers. Then, during winters, they stop growing to preserve energy.

During this time they can also use the stored water in order to protect their cells. Some plants do this by shifting water to the surface of the skin, allowing it to form ice crystals there. This results in the insides of the cells becoming dehydrated and very syrupy with dissolved substances that act as a sort of antifreeze, protecting the cell from freezing and dying. Then, when the weather gets warmer, the plant can quickly shift water back into the cells to resume metabolic processes and protect against desiccation.

Some plants have evolved large underground storage organs like bulbs, corms, or tubers to store not only water but also sugars and nutrients. These structures allow plants to store large amounts of resources for the long winters, and sprout quickly in early spring when the thaw begins.

Other plants that do not need to survive through the winter instead drop their seeds, which have much lower moisture and are either in the soil or under the snow, which keeps them from getting damaged from the cold. Some seeds have developed mechanisms where they require prolonged exposure to cold, called vernalisation, before germinating, ensuring that they sprout only after the winter ends. This prevents premature germination during temporary thaws.

A lot of trees and other similar plants have evolved tough, resinous bark or thick outer layers that serve as insulation during the winter. These layers can also be used to deter winter herbivores that might otherwise rely on dormant plants for sustenance.
# Agricultural Developments
A lot of agricultural developments are area specific, which is detailed in the [[Agriculture#Regions|Regions]] section. This section will give a general overview to how agriculture has adapted to the environment of Avasar.
