# Introduction
Due to the long year, agriculture on Avasar has had to adapt to the harsh environments. While long summers create ample opportunities for growing crops, the harsh and long winters can cause severe famine if not prepared for properly.

Different areas have developed different methods for coping with these environmental challenges. For area specific solutions to these issues, refer to the [[Agriculture#Regions|Regions]] section below.
# Evolution of Crops & Plants
A lot of the crops and plants on Avasar have evolved to have a long growth period, allowing for extensive growths and large yields. Due to the long year a lot of plants have had to adapt to survive the long winters. They do this by storing water in the stems, roots, etc during the summers. Then, during winters, they stop growing to preserve energy.

During this time they can also use the stored water in order to protect their cells. Some plants do this by shifting water to the surface of the skin, allowing it to form ice crystals there. This results in the insides of the cells becoming dehydrated and very syrupy with dissolved substances that act as a sort of antifreeze, protecting the cell from freezing and dying. Then, when the weather gets warmer, the plant can quickly shift water back into the cells to resume metabolic processes and protect against desiccation.

Some plants have evolved large underground storage organs like bulbs, corms, or tubers to store not only water but also sugars and nutrients. These structures allow plants to store large amounts of resources for the long winters, and sprout quickly in early spring when the thaw begins.

Other plants that do not need to survive through the winter instead drop their seeds, which have much lower moisture and are either in the soil or under the snow, which keeps them from getting damaged from the cold. Some seeds have developed mechanisms where they require prolonged exposure to cold, called vernalisation, before germinating, ensuring that they sprout only after the winter ends. This prevents premature germination during temporary thaws.

A lot of trees and other similar plants have evolved tough, resinous bark or thick outer layers that serve as insulation during the winter. These layers can also be used to deter winter herbivores that might otherwise rely on dormant plants for sustenance.
# Agricultural Developments
A lot of agricultural developments are area specific, which is detailed in the [[Agriculture#Regions|Regions]] section. This section will give a general overview to how agriculture has adapted to the environment of Avasar, and general techniques used to exploit different plants.

A lot of farmers rely heavily on long-season crops and perennial plants capable of overwintering. Some farmers have resorted to selective breeding or magically engineering crops, focusing on enhancing water storage organ size, antifreeze properties, or rapid regrowth capacity after dormancy. They have also developed various techniques for safely storing seeds, either in natural ice caves or artificially controlled environments.

Since many plants store water internally for winter, irrigation during the summer growing season is crucial to ensure plants can build up reserves. Soil enrichment techniques, like biochar or composting, is also used to enhance nutrient storage for plants during dormancy.

Depending on the season, farmers might grow two different types of crops; long-season crops that dominate during the summer, and cold-tolerant, fast-growing crops like hardy greens that can thrive in early spring or late autumn before the frost sets in.
## Crop Sheltering
Different ways of sheltering growing plants during the winter might be used. In harsher regions, this might involve constructing thermal shelters or insulated greenhouses. These shelters might house perennials that remain semi-dormant but need additional warmth to survive, or they might be fully climate controlled, allowing for the growing of plants as if it were summer conditions. This causes other issues however, with difficulties using fertilizer that combined with the sun might burn and kill the plants. Increased pest control and ventilation would also be needed.

[Hydroponics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroponics) or aquaponic systems might also be used, where plants are grown in nutrient solutions. Waste heat from geothermal or other energy sources could provide additional warmth during winter. Underground farming during off-seasons is also common, with for example mushrooms. Some nations have developed magical light sources that mimic the sun that c
## Crop Surplus
Due to long and prosperous farming seasons, nations might produce much more than they consume. Societies use large-scale storage solutions, like underground silos, to preserve surplus crops over the long winter months. Crops like grains, legumes, and tubers dominate due to their storability. Different crops have different methods of preservations, such as storing potatoes in sand, drying beans, or freezing peas.

Crop surplus, regional variations in growing seasons, and climate have encouraged nations to set up robust trade networks. Farmers in temperate zones might trade stored food with equatorial zones that grow fresh produce year-round.
# Regions
Regions are listed by climate type, not by geographical region. Each nation should specify what climate they have for an easy lookup below. Different regions have come up with different ways to tackle the challenges each environment present, and each have made their own innovations in agricultural technology.
## Temperate Zones
**Moderate Winters and Long Summers**

Farmers focus on long-season crops like grain, legumes, and oilseeds. They utilize extensive field agriculture with crop rotation and the integration of cover crops to protect the soil during winter dormancy.
## Arctic-Like Zones
**Extreme Winters**

A lot of hardy perennials are used, like winter-resistant root crops, shrubs, or trees. Farmers utilize a lot of snow-insulated farming, heated greenhouses, or underground farming. Mushroom farming is also common.
## Tropical or Equatorial Zones
**Milder Seasons**

Farmers focus on growing plants with minimal dormancy periods, and continuous crop production. They use agroforestry systems combining perennial crops with annuals to make use of extended growing seasons. They rely heavily on year-round irrigation and different pest management strategies.
## Mountainous Regions
Due to the difficult ground conditions, farmers use a lot of terrace farming with specialized cold-resistant crops like grains, pulses, or berries. They try to make use of natural thermal gradients to grow plants at different elevations and use snow-melt for irrigation.
## Desert-Like Zones
**High Heat and Harsh Winters**

Focus on drought- and frost-resistant plants with extensive root systems. High focus on rainwater harvesting, underground cisterns for irrigation, and strategic planting to shield crops from harsh winds.
