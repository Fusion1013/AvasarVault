# Overview
One of the minor [[Pantheon Overview|Gods]], attuned to [[Terozin, Plane of Weather & Seas|Terozin]].
# Domain
Merstur is the god of weather, oceans, storms, and natural disasters. He embodies the raw, unyielding power of the natural forces, encompassing its beauty, fury, and unpredictability. Merstur governs the rhythm of the seas, the rise and fall of tides, the shifting winds, and the crackling storms that reshape the earth.
# Symbology
Most symbols incorporate the storms into their iconography. A flash of lightning in a summer cloud, rolling waves on the ocean, or stormy clouds over the horizon. They can be used to depict the silence before a coming storm, or the chaos when you are in the middle of one. Deep blues, grays and blacks are often used to represent Merstur, representing the vastness of the ocean, stormy clouds, and the destructive aspects of Merstur's domain.
# Worship
Mortals who worship Merstur often do so out of respect or fear of his power. Merstur does not demand worship however, instead he values resilience above all else and respects mortals who endure his fury without bending, those who adapt to the chaos of life and emerge stronger.

Sailors and seafarers look to Merstur as their protector and guide on the seas, offering prayers and sacrifices before setting out on voyages. They know that he can both guide them safely across the waves and drag them to the ocean's depths.

Farmers depend on his rains for their crops but fear the floods and storms that can wipe them out. They revere him as the life force of the land, offering gratitude for his blessings while remaining wary of his unpredictable moods.

Some mortals are  drawn to Merstur's chaos, worshiping him as the embodiment of adventure and unpredictability. They seek out the untamed wilds, embracing the dangers of his storms as a way to prove their own resilience. Worshippers.
