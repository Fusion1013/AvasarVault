# Overview
One of the minor [[Pantheon Overview|Gods]], attuned to [[Verdus, the Earthweaver]].
# Domain
Verdus holds domain over the living tapestry of the natural world. She is the embodiment of growth, preservation, and the interconnected web of life that flourishes across Avasar. Verdus oversees the delicate balance between nature's resilience and its fragility. Her domain extends across the verdant expanse of forests, the muted colors of the wetlands, and the flourishing gardens within cities.
# Symbology
Symbols used by followers of Verdus are often made using natural materials, such as wood, flowers, or other plants. One common symbol is the Woven Vine, a motif of interwoven vines, leaves, and roots forming circular or spiral patterns. This symbol might be found on temples, grown and formed using magic. Or it could be found in the form of amulets or bracelets worn by her followers.

Temples are usually built around an important tree of some kind. These could be trees of some historical significance, or trees planted by Verdus herself.
# Worship
Most temples are smaller and located in forests. In rare cases larger temples can be found in cities, though mostly in major cities and often close to a park or other nature-dense location. Followers are seen as protectors of nature around their region, with the temple being their safe haven. Many take up druidic magic, as a way to get closer to nature and in order to be able to protect it. Followers can be found working in animal sanctuaries, or other spaces that value nature and animals. They usually work closely with followers of [[Anvarra, the Soulless Mistress|Anvarra]], since their goals often overlap.

Some extreme followers believe that cities and infrastructure are a threat to nature, and might take steps to halt their development.
