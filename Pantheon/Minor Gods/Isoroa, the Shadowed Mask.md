# Overview
One of the minor [[Pantheon Overview|Gods]], attuned to [[Eatrev, Plane of Lies|Eatrev]].
# Domain
Isoroa is the goddess of trickery, deception, and illusions. She holds dominion over all aspects of concealment, misdirection, and cleverness. She is the whispers in the shadows, the hidden hand behind an unexpected fortune, and the smile that hides a dagger. Her presence is felt in the clever lies that protect secrets, the artistry of well-crafted illusions, and the cunning strategies employed to outwit one's enemies.
# Symbology
There are not many symbols used to represent Isoroa, as worshippers tend to not wear anything to indicate their relationship towards the goddess. Some followers might wear a hidden medallion or ring of some kind, though it is fairly uncommon. These items often depict a mask of some kind, symbolizing the hiding of secrets.
# Worship
Her teachings often appeal to those who live by their wits; rogues, illusionists, spies, politicians, and even performers. She also finds worshipers among those who value freedom and adaptability, particularly those who see deception as a necessary skill for survival. Worshipers of Isoroa and [[Vuzen, the Law Baron]] often clash, as many of Isoroa's followers have little respect for the laws of the land.

Isoroa inspires artistry and creativity, particularly to those who create simple illusions or weave compelling stories. Whether through magic, performance, or simple cunning, her followers revel in the power of illusion to evoke wonder and awe. Followers often honor her by performing clever tricks, pranks, or acts of subterfuge. These can range from harmless mischief to elaborate ruses that showcase their ingenuity.

The darker side of Isoroa embodies deceit with malicious intent; the betrayals that shatter trust, the manipulations that lead others to ruin, and the use of lies to exploit and harm. Her influence can bring chaos and heartbreak when guile is used selfishly or cruelly.

Due to the nature of her teachings, followers of Isoroa do not have the best of reputations. Due to this, there are not many temples dedicated to her. Instead, worshipers might gather in theatre groups, travelling performers, or secret underground networks. This is not something that has caused great bother however, as due to their very nature they prefer to keep their worship a secret.
