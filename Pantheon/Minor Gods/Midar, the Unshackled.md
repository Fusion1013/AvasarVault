# Overview
One of the minor [[Pantheon Overview|Gods]], attuned to [[Kaos]].
# Domain
Midar, the Unshackled, is the divine embodiment of chaos, freedom, and adaptability. His domain thrives in the absence of order, in the midst of spontaneity and individuality. To follow Midar is to embrace the unpredictable, to revel in the ever-shifting tides of existence, and to cast off the chains of convention and expectation. Midar represents the boundless potential of life untethered, as well as the chaos that arises when structure collapses.
# Symbology

# Worship
There are not many permanent temples to Midar. Most places of worship come and go, with followers usually not staying in one location for very long. Many tend to pick up adventuring, or other occupations where any sort of permanence is minimized. There are not many organized events, ceremonies or rites. Followers are instead free to show their devotion in whichever way they see fit.
