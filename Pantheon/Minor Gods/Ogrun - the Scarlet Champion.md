# Overview
One of the minor [[Pantheon Overview|Gods]], attuned to [[Stratosia, Plane of War|Stratosia]].
# Domain
Ogrun is the god of glory, violence, honor, and bloodshed - a divine embodiment of the warrior's spirit and the chaos of combat. His domain encompasses all aspects of war, from the raw brutality of battle to the disciplined honor of warriors who fight with purpose. To Ogrun, war and conflict is not just an inevitability but a sacred rite that defines strength, character, and the pursuit of glory. His followers believe that through battle, mortals ascend to their truest selves, and that through bloodshed, their names are immortalized in the annals of history.

The Blood Chalice is another common symbol, taking the form of a chalice filled with blood, representing victory and the sacred essence of life given and taken in combat. Ritualistic drinking of blood or wine may accompany its symbolism.
# Symbology
Worshippers of Ogrun use various war inspired symbology, such as different weapons, shields, or red-coloured banners. One common symbol is the Crimson Gauntlet. The gauntlet symbolizes strength, martial prowess, and the hands that wield weapons and shape glory. When depicted in crimson, it represents the blood spilled in combat and the glory earned through it. Some design variations have the gauntlet clutching a sword or a shield, others have the gauntlet raised in victory or splattered with blood.
# Worship
A lot of followers to the God of War are soldiers. Most temples contain some sort of arena, with organized combat events where challengers can fight for honor and glory. They also often include training areas, where followers can enhance their strength and abilities. Many temples have a hierarchy of priests where rites of combat often decide the ranks.

Followers of Ogrun believe that the highest honor they can give to their god is to die in glorious combat, and to bring as many enemies down with them as possible. They will actively seek out combat, seek out war, to fulfil this purpose.

Weapons broken in glorious battle are sometimes offered to shrines or altars engraved with symbols like the Crimson Glove or Blood Chalice, as a tribute to Ogrun.
