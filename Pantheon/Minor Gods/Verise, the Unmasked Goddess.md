# Overview
One of the minor [[Pantheon Overview|Gods]], attuned to [[Vertae, Plane of Truth|Vertae]].
# Domain
Verise is the goddess of common sense, honesty, and truth. Verise's influence spans everything from small, everyday decisions, to the deep, immutable truths that govern existence. Her domain emphasizes that truth, while powerful and often liberating, can also be harsh and uncompromising.
# Symbology
A lot of icons and symbology have common themes of representing the unveiling or uncovering of hidden truths, imagery that symbolizes illumination and understanding. One of the most popular symbols is the Open Eye, an eye often surrounded by rays of light or framed by a single geometric shape. Another symbol is the Piercing Blade, often depicted piercing through a veil or shattering a mask. These symbols often come in white, silver, and gold colorations. White and silver represent purity, honesty, and clarity, and gold represent enlightenment, wisdom, and the value of truth.
# Worship
Followers believe in truth, absolute truth. Some more extreme followers believe that one should always tell the truth, no matter the consequences that might come from it or who might get hurt by it. Worshippers can commonly be found within law - as judges, investigators, or similar occupations where finding the truth is a core theme. Temples can provide services where patrons can come and confess, a place where people can tell the truth without consequence. There are temples that can provide services of enchantment magic, where someone could be forced to tell the truth through magical means. Some more extreme followers might believe in truth at any cost, which could mean torturing someone for the truth in rare circumstances. Illusion magic is generally frowned upon but tolerated, though some temples and individuals go out of their way to prevent anyone from using it.
