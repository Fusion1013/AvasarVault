# Overview
One of the minor [[Pantheon Overview|Gods]], attuned to [[Aurora Ortus]].
# Domain
Saheir embodies the infinite and mysterious essence of magic in all its forms. She is the patron of arcane knowledge, and the intangible magical forces that bind reality together. She represents magic as a tool for creation, destruction, transformation, and enlightenment - a force of boundless potential.

Dreams hold special significance in Saheir's domain. She is said to dwell within the dreamscape, weaving threads of arcane inspiration into reality. To her followers, dreams are not mere fantasies but reflections of hidden truths, gateways to the subconscious, and pathways to divine communion.
# Symbology
There are a lot of symbols used to represent the Mistress of the Arcane. One of the more common ones is the Starburst Tome, a book, often depicted open, with a starburst or magical glyph emerging from its pages. It represents the revelation of knowledge and the transformative power of learning. It can commonly be found carved into altars or painted on temple walls.

Another symbol is the Veiled Eye, an eye partially obscured by a veil, clouds, or flowing ribbons. It symbolizes insight, the hidden truths of dreams, and the mysteries of magic yet to be uncovered. Dreamwalkers often paint or tattoo this symbol on their bodies.

The Dreamcatcher is another common symbol among Dreamwalkers. It takes the form of a dreamcatcher, often interwoven with glowing runes or stars instead of traditional beads. It represents Saheir's dominion over dreams.

Violet, silver and gold are common colors used by followers of Saheir. Violet represents mystery and dreamscape, silver represents moonlight, reflection, and the arcane, and gold represents enlightenment and the pursuit of knowledge.
# Worship
Followers are often scholars that devote themselves to studying, practicing, and experimenting with both arcane and divine magic. Spellcraft, enchantment, potion-making, or creating magical artefacts are common practice. Some worshippers deliberately push the boundaries of magic, exploring rare or dangerous schools of magic to demonstrate their dedication to understanding its full potential. Most followers do not believe that such a thing as ‘good’ or ‘bad’ magic exists and instead think that magic is a neutral force.

Followers commonly work together with followers of [[Veda, the Elder Scribe]], as their goals often overlap. Collecting, preserving, and sharing arcane knowledge is a fundamental way to honor Saheir.

Some followers engage in rituals to enter the [[Plane of Dreams]] and commune with Saheir. This may involve meditation, use of various substances or enchanted artefacts such as dreamcatchers or moonstone charms. Dreamwalkers, a subgroup of Saheir's followers, actively explore dreams - both their own and others. They believe that Saheir often speaks through dreams, sending cryptic visions or riddles to guide her followers.
