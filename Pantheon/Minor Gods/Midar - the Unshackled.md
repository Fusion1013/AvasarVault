# Overview
One of the minor [[Pantheon Overview|Gods]], attuned to [[Kaos]].
# Domain
Midar, the Unshackled, is the divine embodiment of chaos, freedom, and adaptability. His domain thrives in the absence of order, in the midst of spontaneity and individuality. To follow Midar is to embrace the unpredictable, to revel in the ever-shifting tides of existence, and to cast off the chains of convention and expectation. Midar represents the boundless potential of life untethered, as well as the chaos that arises when structure collapses.
# Symbology
There are few symbols representing Midar, as his followers have a hard time settling on specific designs that they feel represent Midar. One symbol has arisen from the chaos however, the Broken Chain. It is a powerful symbol of freedom and defiance, and represents the act of breaking free from oppression, restrictions, and limitations.

Shattered or damaged objects are often kept as sacred tokens, symbolizing the beauty of imperfection and the inevitability of change.

There are no specific colors tied to Midar.
# Worship
Worship of Midar is as chaotic and individualized as the god himself. His followers reject traditional, structured ceremonies and instead express their devotion in spontaneous, personal, and often unconventional ways. Many tend to pick up adventuring, or other occupations where any sort of permanence is minimized. There are not many organized events, ceremonies or rites. There are also not many permanent temples to Midar. Most places of worship come and go, with followers usually not staying in one location for very long.
