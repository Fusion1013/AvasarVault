# Overview
One of the minor [[Pantheon Overview|Gods]], attuned to [[Kalament, Plane of Peace|Kalament]].
# Domain
Irellia is the embodiment of peace, stillness, and unity, but also of apathy and inaction. She represents the calm waters that soothe the soul, the silence that follows conflict, and the serenity that comes from balance.

Her influence is felt in moments of ceasefire, the mediation of disputes, and the cooperation needed for rebuilding. At the same time, her shadow falls over the quiet apathy of those who refuse to act in the face of hardship, allowing troubles to fester in the stillness of inattention.
# Symbology
The most common symbology by far used to represent Irellia is the Tranquil Lake itself. A vast body of water, completely still. It symbolizes peace, calm, and the reflective nature of her domain. It is often accompanied by the Still Moon, a full moon reflected on the water's surface. It represents harmony and unbroken serenity. The moon could also be a crescent in some depictions, representing detachment and the passive observation of the world. The moon also shows the ties Irellia has to [[Lu'Syl, the Twilight Twins]], and the similarities that they share.
# Worship
Irellia's worshipers are often those who value peace and balance; mediators, pacifists, and seekers of inner tranquillity. Some followers work closely together with those of [[Lu'Syl, the Twilight Twins]], as they share many similar practices.

A lot of worship towards Irellia focuses on meditation. Reaching inwards and finding inner peace. Those that seek themselves to temples of Irellia might be ones searching calm amidst chaos, or ones who find satisfaction in idleness. Her indifferent aspects might also appeal to those who embrace detachment, such as hermits or individuals who wish to escape the pressures of the world.

Irellia's teachings are subtle and contradictory. She teaches that peace is sacred, yet that conflict is often a necessary precursor to resolution. Cooperation is vital, but over-dependence breeds weakness. Idleness can bring clarity, but unchecked it can lead to decay. Her followers are left to interpret these teachings and forge their own path forward, finding their own balance.
