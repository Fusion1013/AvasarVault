# Overview
One of the minor [[Pantheon Overview|Gods]], attuned to [[Stratosia, Plane of War]].
# Domain
Ogrun is the god of glory, violence, honor, and bloodshed - a divine embodiment of the warrior's spirit and the chaos of combat. His domain encompasses all aspects of war, from the raw brutality of battle to the disciplined honor of warriors who fight with purpose. To Ogrun, war and conflict is not just an inevitability but a sacred rite that defines strength, character, and the pursuit of glory. His followers believe that through battle, mortals ascend to their truest selves, and that through bloodshed, their names are immortalized in the annals of history.
# Symbology

# Worship
A lot of followers to the God of War are soldiers. Most temples contain some sort of arena, with organized combat events where challengers can fight for honor and glory. They also often include training areas, where followers can enhance their strength and abilities. Many temples have a hierarchy of priests where rites of combat often decide the ranks.
