# Overview
One of the major [[Pantheon Overview|Gods]], attuned to [[Gnosis, Plane of Knowledge|Gnosis]].
# Domain
Veda’s domain contains all aspects of finding, preserving, and distributing knowledge. This includes knowledge of all kinds, magical, non-magical, evil, good. All knowledge is equal in the face of Veda, and is worthy of being preserved.
# Symbology
Followers of Veda use symbology that reinforces the idea of preserving knowledge in all of its forms, and reverence for the pursuit and sharing of information. A popular symbol is the Open Book; a book with its pages spread wide open, symbolizing the accessibility and preservation of knowledge. The pages could either be blank, to show the potential for discovery, or filled with intricate script. Another common symbol is the Quill and Star; a quill pen crossed with a star or a constellation, symbolizing the recording of divine and mortal knowledge. A less common symbol is a key in the form of a quill, inscribed with runes.
# Worship
A lot of the temples act like schools and libraries, and are open to the public. Filled to the brim with books and scrolls containing information recorded by those that tend to the temples. Most followers believe that knowledge should not be restricted, that it should be free to everyone. Many followers might be adventurers that specialize in finding knowledge, such as searching for old books, documenting new findings in the wilds, etc.

A less popular belief is that knowledge should not be shared with those outside the circle, but that it should be hoarded. They might see themselves as protectors of knowledge, keeping it from those undeserved or from those that might seek to destroy it.

While many priests believe that all knowledge should be shared and open to the public, they still understand that knowledge can be dangerous and that they have to abide by the laws set up by the governments surrounding them. To circumvent this, some have constructed secret libraries that share some more ‘forbidden’ knowledge, as they still believe that knowledge should be preserved.
