# Overview
One of the major [[Pantheon Overview|Gods]], attuned to [[Tenebris]] and [[Luminaria]]. They were originally two people that attempted to attune to the same plane at once, causing them to merge into one. They are now known as the Twilight Twins.
# Domain
Lu'Syl usually appears during times of conflict. They represent the duality of things, transformations, opposites working together and clashing. Light and darkness. The twins are unpredictable, something that is reflected in many of their followers. Lu'Syl's presence would often signal moments of great tension or transition, such as a pivotal battle where neither side can claim moral superiority, a critical moment of change in a society or nation, where old orders crumble and new ones emerge, or during a personal journey of inner transformation.
# Symbology
Duality is an important theme with Lu'Syl. Followers of Lu'Syl use a lot of moon-inspired symbology. The Split Moon, a moon divided into two halves, one glowing bright and the other shrouded in darkness. These symbols are usually made from some reflective material, such as metal or glass.
# Worship
Worship towards Lu'Syl can take many forms, as is the nature of the twins. Some worshippers focus of the struggles and conflicts on the inner self, seeking meditation and solitude. Others focus on more physical conflicts, seeking out conflicts through violence or warfare. There are few temples dedicated to Lu'Syl, as followers are unpredictable and have a difficult time settling somewhere. Many also believe that the twins only show up when something terrible is happening or about to happen, giving them a poor reputation. The few temples that do exist are usually smaller ones dedicated to helping people resolve their inner struggles.
