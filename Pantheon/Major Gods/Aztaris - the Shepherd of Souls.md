# Overview
One of the major [[Pantheon Overview|Gods]], attuned to [[The Dark Beyond]].
# Domain
Aztaris represents all aspects of life and death, anything that lives and dies with a soul falls under his domain. He acts to ensure the cycle of life continues to flow, to ensure the inevitable end of every mortal life, and to guide their souls to wherever they need to go. Most followers believe that undeath goes against the will of Aztaris.
# Symbology
A popular symbol is the hourglass, reminding followers that your natural life is finite, that it one day will end. But just as with an hourglass, that it might not be the end. A turn of the hourglass can start another cycle, just as the death of a being can start another cycle of life.

A common piece of iconography used are symmetrical designs with flowing elements that depict cycles, such as weaving threads or spiral shapes.

Different sources of light are important, as they are believed to light the way for lost souls. Lanterns adorned with etched spirals or intertwined vines, candles with skeletal designs.
# Worship
Many temples to Aztaris provide burial services and have many different burial rites and ceremonies that they can perform, in order to guide souls into the afterlife. A lot of temples are built in or close to a graveyard, with followers tending the graves. They believe that death is a natural part of life, that death is the next step and that preventing it is a perversion of its nature. As such, they do not believe in undeath or prolonging life through unnatural means. Some of the most extreme followers might resort to killing those they believe have violated the natural cycle of life and death.

Transitions into different stages of life are in focus during worship. and there are many ceremonies celebrating the different stages of life.
