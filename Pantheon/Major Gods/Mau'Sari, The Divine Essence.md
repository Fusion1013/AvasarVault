# Overview
One of the major [[Pantheon Overview|Gods]], attuned to the [[Elemental Plane of Chaos]]. He was the first mortal to attune to a plane.
# Domain
Mau'Sari holds dominion over entropy and the raw elemental energies. He is the embodiment of change - neither inherently destructive nor creative, but a force of inevitable transition and elemental chaos.
# Symbology
# Worship
Even though Mau'Sari was the first mortal to ascend to godhood, there are not many that worship him.
