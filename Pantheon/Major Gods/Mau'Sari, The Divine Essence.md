# Overview
One of the major [[Pantheon Overview|Gods]], attuned to the [[Elemental Plane of Chaos]]. He was the first mortal to attune to a plane.
# Domain
Mau'Sari holds dominion over entropy and the raw elemental energies. He is the embodiment of change - neither inherently destructive nor creative, but a force of inevitable transition and elemental chaos. His domain encompasses the primal forces that shape the universe; fire, water, earth, and air in their purest forms. He is the embodiment of energy in flux, the ever-changing dance of matter and chaos that permeates existence. Mau'Sari governs not only the elemental forces but also the inevitable decay that must follow creation, ensuring balance through the unending cycle of transformation.
# Symbology
A lot of symbols incorporate the four elements in its iconography. One symbol depicts the Elemental Vortex, a swirling, chaotic spiral composed of the four elements, fire, water, air and earth.
# Worship
Mau'Sari is both feared and respected. He does not demand worship, he is simply indifferent to mortal desires. Those who honor him do so out of respect for his power and the recognition that all things, from the mightiest of civilizations to the most fragile life, are subject to his influence. His followers are not bound by strict rules, instead they are encouraged to seek understanding of the natural forces, channel his energies through them, and accept the inevitability of change.
