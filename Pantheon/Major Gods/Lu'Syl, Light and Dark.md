# Overview
One of the major [[Pantheon Overview|Gods]], attuned to [[Tenebris]] and [[Luminaria]].
# Domain
Lu'Syl usually appears during times of conflicts. They represent the duality of things, transformations, opposites working together and clashing. Light and darkness.
# Symbology
Duality is an important theme with Lu'Syl. Followers of Lu'Syl use a lot of moon-inspired symbology. The Split Moon, a moon divided into two halves, one glowing bright and the other shrouded in darkness.
# Worship
A lot of worship focuses on the conflicts within oneself.
