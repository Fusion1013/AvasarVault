# Overview
One of the major [[Pantheon Overview|Gods]], attuned to [[Vylmat, Plane of Life|Vylmat]].
# Domain
Anvarra acts as a representation of nature as a whole. Anything which is considered to be alive, but lacks a soul, is what she resides over. This includes any form of undeath, as well as constructs. Anything with a spirit, such as animals, are also part of Anvarra's domain.
# Symbology
One common symbol is the Split Tree, which takes the form of a twisted tree, bursting with leaves on one side, dead on the other. It is supposed to symbolize nature on one side and emptiness on the other, with all that binds it in the middle.

Another popular symbol is the Hollow Seed, a seed or nut cracked open to reveal an empty core, representing potential life devoid of a spirit. Followers usually have this symbol as an amulet or carved into wooden artefacts.

Followers usually wear deep green or earthen clothes, as a link to the natural world. Ashen gray or bone white clothing can also be used to represent decay, neutrality, and inorganic life.
# Worship
Many followers of Anvarra do not believe that undeath is a ‘bad’ thing. Some even believe that undeath is the natural progression of life. Temples to Anvarra are often dedicated to nature and the process of becoming closer to nature. Followers have been known to use various herbs and potions to induce a trance-like state, in which they can commune with nature. Because of this, temples are often found on the outskirts of cities, or far outside of cities in forests or other areas of high nature density.

Followers are often dedicated to healing and restoration, and some extreme sects even help others achieve undeath. These rituals are seen as a means to preserve and prolong life, in order to avoid the transition of the Soul into the afterlife. Some even wish to leave their soul behind completely.

While some followers use healing magic to aid those already injured, some believe in preventing damage from occurring in the first place. They often act as peacekeepers for their local communities, with these goals often overlapping with those of followers of [[Irellia - Mistress of the Tranquil Lake|Irellia]]. Most followers are against unnatural deaths, the definition of which differs from group to group. A lot of followers are vegetarians, as they see animals as the purest form of life since they live without souls.

Wind chimes are commonly found within temples to Anvarra. Followers believe that the winds sometimes carry the voice of Anvarra, and that wind chimes are a way to listen to these voices. Candles made from bone or a mixture of wax and ash are sometimes used as decoration. Golems or animal companions often roam freely throughout the temples.
