*"Divinity"*
# Introduction
Within the world of Avasar, there are a total of 5 different prime deities and 10 minor deities. Each prime deity has been tied to one of the [[Planes Overview#Major & Minor Planes|Major Planes]] within the Cosmology of Avasar, and each minor deity to one of the [[Planes Overview#Major & Minor Planes|Minor Planes]]. Only these beings are considered to be part of the main Pantheon. However, other beings such as demi-gods do exist. They are instead attuned to a demiplane or something similar.

These deities are former mortals who were able to be bound to one of the original major planes. Some even tried to attune to a plane that already had a deity, causing the domain, along with the plane and the planet representing it, to be split. However, the secrets to ascend have long been lost.

No singular deity is good or evil. Instead, they are pure representations of the domain they control. This includes any of the positive and negative aspects within that domain. While none of the Pantheon are considered good or evil, certain events can mean their more positive or negative aspects have more influence within the Material Plane.

# History
## Origin
All gods were once mortals that ascended into divinity by attuning themselves to a specific plane. At the start, there were only so many planes to attune to. This resulted in instances of multiple mortals attempting attunement to the same plane. Usually when this happened, the more powerful one would simply supplant the other. Replacing it, killing it. In rare instances however, the plane would split, and as a result the domain would split. An event such as this would significantly weaken both the domain and the deity.

A mortal who failed to take over a domain from a deity would usually face their demise, or rise as a powerful fiend or celestial in service of that deity.
## Planar Concordance
As the planes continued to split and merge in the fervour of ascending mortals, the fabric of reality continued to tear. Become unstable. This instability began to tear into the material plane, creating regions where small, infrequent planar tears would appear.

It all came to a point when one final mortal ascended, splitting another plane. This caused a ripple of planar energy to rock the cosmos. The planes had reached critical mass. The gods decided to come together and in a unified effort killed the newly ascended god, bringing the cosmos into balance once more. To prevent any mortals from continuing to break apart the planes and destroy all they know, the gods hid the secrets to ascension. They agreed to present a united front against anyone who would attempt to ascend. This event became known as the [[0APC - Planar Concordance|Planar Concordance]] and became year 0 for many of the major calendars.
